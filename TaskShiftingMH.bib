  abstract = {Adolescents living in low-resource settings lack access to adequate psychological care. The barriers to mental health care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) include high disease burden, low allocation of resources, lack of national mental health policy and child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) professionals and services, poverty, illiteracy and poor availability of adolescent friendly health services. WHO has recommended a stepped task shifting approach to mental health care in LMIC. Training of non-mental health specialists like peers, teachers, community health workers, paediatricians and primary care physicians by CAMH and framing country-specific evidence-based national mental health policies are vital in overcoming barriers to psychological care in LMIC. Digital technology and telemedicine can be used in providing economical and accessible mental health care services to adolescents.},

  abstract = {The South Asian region, including Pakistan, reports one of the highest rates of perinatal depression. Effective task-shifting perinatal mental health interventions exist and are gaining attention of policy makers, as a potential solution to bridge the existing treatment gap. However, no specific indicators are available to gauge the level of implementation for such interventions in the South Asian region. The Thinking Healthy Programme Peer-delivered (THPP) is a perinatal mental health intervention delivered, at scale, by peer volunteers (PVs). An effectiveness trial for THPP based on 570 depressed pregnant women was conducted in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan. In addition, we also examined the implementation processes of THPP in order to develop an index to gauge implementation strength of this intervention. The key components of this index are based on four important intervention processes related to service provision which include; i) the competence of PVs, ii) supervisions attended by PVs and iii) number and iv) duration of THPP sessions. We attempt to inform an implementation strength index which best correlates with reduced perinatal depression and disability at 6 months post childbirth. Knowledge of such an implementation strength index for a task-shifted perinatal depression intervention carries implications for scale up strategies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Depression is highly prevalent in people living with HIV (PLHIV) worldwide. As mental health specialists are scarce in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the World Health Organization (WHO) encourages task-shifting. We aimed to evaluate the barriers that could compromise task-shifting in front-line health care workers (HCWs) who provide HIV integrated care in West Africa. We collected knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) information on symptoms, causes and management of depression in PLHIV in care in four clinics in Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire (N = 168). The main barriers that could compromise task-shifting came from poor knowledge, particularly on symptoms and causes. Knowledge was more limited in HCWs other than medical doctors (good answers < 70%). The access to a depression training was limited (32.7%) and was the main factor associated to poor knowledge on depression. Even when social distance and barriers to practice were low (70.8% and 69.6%, respectively), some barriers persisted. More than half of respondents considered that diagnosis and management needed to be performed by a specialist. To guarantee the success of task-shifting, in the perspective of integrated care, efforts are needed to improve the access to specific training on depression considering screening, management, but also perceptions and attitudes, as some barriers subsist.},

Professionalizing volunteers through task-shifting results in the transformation of their philosophy of community care, which constrains and narrows understandings of mental health care. The state, in alliance with psychiatric NGOs, front-stages development through aggressive task-shifting which we argue is a socio-politico-moral process, disrupting the shared consciousness between volunteers and their own communities with fatal consequences for their most vulnerable citizens.},

  abstract = {Importance: Approximately 140 million children worldwide have experienced the death of one or both parents. These children, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, have higher rates of mental health problems than those who have not experienced parental death. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve the well-being of these children, but to our knowledge there have been no randomized clinical trials specifically focused on this population., Objectives: To test the effectiveness of trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) for improving posttraumatic stress (PTS) in children in Kenya and Tanzania who have experienced parental death, to test the effects of TF-CBT on other mental health symptoms, and to examine the feasibility of task-shifting with greater reliance on experienced, local lay counselors as trainers and supervisors., Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial conducted in urban and rural areas of Tanzania and Kenya compared TF-CBT and usual care (UC) for 640 children aged 7 to 13 years who were recruited from February 13, 2013, to July 24, 2015. All children had experienced the death of one or both parents and had elevated PTS and/or prolonged grief. Interviewers were masked to study condition. Participants were followed up for 12 months after the randomized clinical trial. Statistical analysis was performed from February 3, 2017, to August 26, 2019. All analyses were on an intent-to-treat basis., Interventions: In the intervention condition, 320 children received 12 weeks of group TF-CBT delivered by lay counselors who were supervised weekly. In the UC condition, 320 children received community services typically offered to this population., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was PTS, evaluated using a continuous, standardized measure. Other mental health symptoms and child-guardian relationship were also measured., Results: A total of 640 children (320 girls and 320 boys; mean [SD] age, 10.6 [1.6] years) were included in the study. Trauma-focused CBT was more effective than UC for PTS in 3 of 4 sites after treatment (end of 3-month randomized clinical trial): rural Kenya (Cohen d = 1.04 [95% CI, 0.72-1.36]), urban Kenya (Cohen d = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.29-0.83]), and urban Tanzania (Cohen d = 0.45 [95% CI, 0.10-0.80]). At 12-month follow-up, TF-CBT remained more effective than UC in both rural (Cohen d = 0.86 [95% CI, 0.64-1.07]) and urban (Cohen d = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.75-1.23]) Kenya. At 12-month follow-up in Tanzania, children who received TF-CBT and UC had comparable rates of improvement (rural Tanzania, Cohen d = 0.09 [95% CI, -0.08 to 0.26]; urban Tanzania, Cohen d = 0.11 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.31]). A similar pattern was seen for secondary outcomes, with stronger effects observed in Kenya, where children experienced greater stress and adversity (eg, more food scarcity, poorer guardian health, and greater exposure to traumatic events)., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that TF-CBT was more effective than UC in reducing PTS among children who experienced parental death in 3 of 4 sites in Kenya and Tanzania. At 12-month follow-up, TF-CBT was more effective in reducing PTS only among children in rural and urban Kenya., Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01822366.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of brief school-nurse-administered interventions for reducing anxiety. Thirty school nurses in Connecticut and Maryland were randomly assigned to deliver the Child Anxiety Learning Modules (CALM; n = 14) or CALM-Relaxation only (CALM-R; n = 16). Students (N = 54) were ages 5-12 (M age = 8; 84.9% White; 68.5% female) with elevated anxiety symptoms and/or anxiety disorders. Feasibility was assessed based on recruitment, retention, attendance, training and intervention satisfaction, and intervention adherence. Multiple informants, including independent evaluators (IEs), completed measures of clinical improvement at postintervention and at a 3-month follow-up. Of nurses in CALM and CALM-R, 62% and 81%, respectively, enrolled a student and completed an average of 6 sessions. Youth retention was 85% and 94% in CALM and CALM-R, respectively. Training and intervention satisfaction were high. At postintervention and follow-up, youth in both groups showed significant reductions in anxiety and related symptoms and improvements in functioning. Within-group effect sizes were medium to large, and between-group effect sizes were small. Task shifting responsibility for delivering brief mental health interventions to school nurses is feasible and shows promise for reducing anxiety and related impairment. This approach may also be integrated within a response to intervention model used in schools. Public Health Significance: Brief school-nurse-administered anxiety reduction interventions were shown to be feasible and had a positive impact on student anxiety and related impairment highlighting that school nurses can be an important school resource.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children whose families are involved with child welfare services manifest disproportionately high levels of behavioral difficulties, which could be addressed in community-based organizations providing services to prevent out-of-home placement. Unfortunately, few evidence based practices have been successfully implemented in child welfare settings, especially those originally delivered by mental health providers. Given that such settings typically employ caseworkers who lack prior mental health training, this is a significant barrier to implementation. Consequently, the overall aim of the current study is test the feasibility of shifting a mental health intervention from specialized services to community-based organizations. It uses task-shifting and the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to implement an evidence based intervention to reduce child behavior difficulties, originally provided by mental health practitioners, so that it can be delivered by caseworkers providing placement prevention services to child welfare-involved families. Task-shifting involves (1) modifying the intervention for provision by non-mental health providers; (2) training non-mental health providers in the modified intervention; and (3) establishing regular supervision and monitoring by mental health specialists., METHODS: This study uses the 4Rs and 2Ss Program for Strengthening Families, a multiple family group service delivery model to reduce child behavior difficulties, as the example intervention. This intervention has had prior success with child welfare-involved families. The proposed study objectives are: (1) to tailor the content, training, and supervision of the intervention for delivery by caseworkers serving child welfare-involved families; and (2) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention. Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods will assess feasibility and acceptability from key stakeholders (caseworkers, supervisors, administrators, caregivers). In Phase I, a Collaborative Advisory Board will be convened (1) to modify the intervention to be delivered by caseworkers in placement prevention service settings; and (2) to develop training and supervision protocols for caseworkers. In Phase 2, the modified intervention will be pilot tested for delivery by n=4 caseworkers to n=20 families receiving placement preventive services (where children manifest behavior problems). Mixed quantitative/qualitative methods will be used to assess feasibility and acceptability., DISCUSSION: This protocol will be of particular interest to agency administrators, program managers, and researchers interested in developing and testing cross-setting implementation guidelines for similar evidence based practices.},

Patients (n=200) from two ECs in Cape Town, South Africa were interviewed using the SRQ-20 and the MINI. Internal consistency, screening properties and factorial validity were examined. The SRQ-20 was effective in identifying participants with major depression, anxiety disorders or suicidality and displayed good internal consistency. The optimal cutoff scores were 4/5 and 6/7 for men and women respectively. The factor structure differed by gender. The SRQ-20 is a useful tool for EC settings in South Africa and holds promise for task-shifted approaches to decreasing the LMIC burden of mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric illness that is among the world's top 10 causes of long-term disability, affecting people who are just entering the peak of social, economic, and intellectual productivity. Such functional loss is particularly relevant in indigenous communities, which rely on change in functional status (rather than on the presence of symptoms) to identify mental illness. Particularly among the indigenous communities of Latin America, the gap between mental health need and availability of resources to reduce the burden has been judged "a case of outrageous exclusion." For more than a decade, as part of the Investigation of Movement Abnormalities and Genetic of Schizophrenia study, the authors have been studying vulnerability markers (genetic, motor, imaging, and neuropsychological differences) for schizophrenia in a remote, indigenous population in rural northern Argentina. In this article, the authors discuss the implementation of a task-shifting paradigm resulting in more proficient identification and referral of individuals with untreated psychosis and a severalfold reduction in the duration of untreated psychosis, with very high retention rates (70%) and treatment adherence during a decade in a rural environment. The authors also propose to use transcranial ultrasound screening and testing for parkinsonism at illness onset before introduction of neuroleptics as potentially useful markers in determining illness severity, negative symptomatology, and tolerance to antipsychotic treatment/refractoriness.},

Given infection control requirements, we have instituted modular staffing for our inpatient and outpatient settings, necessitating task shifting and an increased use of technology for communication. Because of the reduced outpatient capacity and the need to minimize nonurgent trips to the hospital, we have implemented telemedicine and have leveraged on partnerships with school counselors and other community partners. "Coronaphobia" has influenced our patients' willingness to attend visits and worsened existing health anxiety for some. Responsiveness to families' and patients' health and financial concerns has been essential.

Generalists need long-term support to master new skills and changes to work context are required to sustain change in the face of competing priorities. We examined program and context factors promoting sustainability of a mental health task-shifting training for hospital-based HIV providers in Ethiopia., Methods: Convergent mixed-methods quasi-experimental study. Sustained impact was measured by trained/not-trained provider differences in case detection and management 16 months following the end of formal support. Factors related to sustainability were examined through interviews with trained providers., Results: Extent of sustained impact: Trained providers demonstrated modest but better agreement with standardized screeners (greater sensitivity with similar specificity). They were more likely to request that patients with mental health problems return to see them v. making a referral. Factors promoting sustainability (reported in semi-structured interviews): provider belief that the treatments they had learned were effective. New interactions with on-site mental health staff were a source of ongoing learning and encouragement. Factors diminishing sustainability: providers feelings of isolation when mental health partners left for work elsewhere, failure to incorporate mental health indicators into administrative data, to re-stock staff education materials, and to build formal mechanisms for generalist-mental health staff interaction., Conclusions: An intervention seen as feasible and effective, and promotion of relationships across professional lines, helped generalists sustain new skills. Failure to address key system context issues made use of the skills unsustainable as external supports ended.},

These adversities may put Syrian refugees at high risk for common mental disorders. In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a trans-diagnostic scalable psychological intervention called Problem Management Plus (PM+) to reduce psychological distress among populations exposed to adversities. PM+ has been adapted for Syrian refugees and can be delivered by non-specialist peer lay persons in the community., METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with 380 Syrian refugees in Turkey. After providing informed consent, participants with high levels of psychological distress (scoring above 15 on the Kessler-10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10)) and functional impairment (scoring above 16 on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, or WHODAS 2.0) will be randomly assigned to Group PM+/enhanced care as usual (Group PM+/E-CAU) (n = 190) or E-CAU (n = 190). Outcome assessments will take place 1 week after the fifth session (post-assessment), 3 months after the fifth session and 12 months after baseline assessment. The primary outcome is psychological distress as measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25). Secondary outcomes include functional impairment, post-traumatic stress symptoms, self-identified problems, and health system and productivity costs. A process evaluation will be conducted to explore the feasibility, challenges and success of the intervention with 25 participants, including participants, facilitators, policy makers and mental health professionals., DISCUSSION: The treatment manual of the Syrian-Arabic Group PM+ and training materials will be made available through the WHO once the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Group PM+ have been established., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03960892. Unique protocol ID: 10/2017. Prospectively registered on 21 May 2019.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global policy recommendations suggest a task-shifted model of post-diagnostic dementia care, moving towards primary and community-based care. It is unclear how this may best be delivered., AIM: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary care-based models of post-diagnostic dementia care., DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic review of trials and economic evaluations of post-diagnostic dementia care interventions where primary care was substantially involved in care plan decision making., METHOD: Searches were undertaken of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL (from inception to March 2019). Two authors independently critically appraised studies and inductively classified interventions into types of care models. Random effects meta-analysis or narrative synthesis was conducted for each model where appropriate., RESULTS: From 4506 unique references and 357 full texts, 23 papers were included from 10 trials of nine interventions, delivered in four countries. Four types of care models were identified. Primary care provider (PCP)-led care (n = 1) led to better caregiver mental health and reduced hospital and memory clinic costs compared with memory clinics. PCP-led care with specialist consulting support (n = 2) did not have additional effects on clinical outcomes or costs over usual primary care. PCP-case management partnership models (n = 6) offered the most promise, with impact on neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver burden, distress and mastery, and healthcare costs. Integrated primary care memory clinics (n = 1) had limited evidence for improved quality of life and cost-effectiveness compared with memory clinics., CONCLUSION: Partnership models may impact on some clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. More rigorous evaluation of promising primary care-led care models is needed. Copyright © British Journal of General Practice 2020.},

  abstract = {Clinical practice guidelines direct mental health services to provide preventive care to address client chronic disease risk behaviours, however, this care is not routinely provided. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to increase provision of preventive care by mental health services; by care element (ask, assess, advice, assist, arrange) and risk behaviour (tobacco smoking, poor nutrition, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity). Electronic bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, relevant journals, and included study reference lists were searched. Eligible studies were of any design with a comparison group that reported the effectiveness of an intervention to increase the provision of at least one element of preventive care for at least one risk behaviour in a mental health setting. Twenty studies were included, most commonly examining smoking (n = 20) and 'ask' (n = 12). Meta-analysis found interventions involving task shifting were effective in increasing smoking 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.009) and physical activity 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.002). Overall, meta-analysis and narrative synthesis indicated that effective intervention strategies (categorised according to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care taxonomy) were: task shifting, educational meetings, health information systems, local consensus processes, authority and accountability, and reminders. The most consistent findings across studies were with regard to preventive care for smoking, while conflicting or limited evidence was found regarding other risk behaviours. While further rigorous research examining key risk behaviours is recommended, the findings may inform the selection of strategies for future interventions and service delivery initiatives.

  abstract = {Background: Maternal depression affects one in five women in low-and middle income countries (LMIC) and has significant economic and social impacts. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions delivered by non-specialist health workers are recommended as first-line management of the condition, and recent studies on such interventions from LMIC show promising results. However, lack of human resource to deliver the interventions is a major bottle-neck to scale-up, and much research attention has been devoted to 'task-sharing' initiatives. A peer-delivered version of the World Health Organization's Thinking Healthy Programme for perinatal depression in Pakistan and India showed clinical, functional and social benefits to women at 3 months postpartum. The programme has been iteratively adapted and continually delivered for 5 years in Pakistan. In this report, we describe the extended intervention and factors contributing to the peers' continued motivation and retention, and suggest future directions to address scale-up challenges., Methods: The study was conducted in rural Rawalpindi. We used mixed methods to evaluate the programme 5 years since its initiation. The competency of the peers in delivering the intervention was evaluated using a specially developed Quality and Competency Checklist, an observational tool used by trainers to rate a group session on key areas of competencies. In-depth interviews explored factors contributing to the peer volunteers' continued motivation and retention, as well as the key challenges faced., Results: Our key findings are that about 70% of the peer volunteers inducted 5 years ago continued to be part of the programme, retaining their competency in delivering the intervention, with only token financial incentives. Factors contributing to sustained motivation included altruistic aspirations, enhanced social standing in the community, personal benefits to their own mental health, and the possibility for other avenues of employment. Long-term challenges included demotivation due to lack of certainty about the programme's future, increased requirement for financial incentivisation, the logistics of organising groups in the community, and resistance from some families to the need for ongoing care., Conclusions: The programme, given the sustained motivation and competence of peer volunteers in delivering the intervention, has the potential for long-term sustainability in under-resourced settings and a candidate for scale-up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a considerable shortfall in specialized health care professionals worldwide to deliver health services, and this shortfall is especially pronounced in low-middle-income countries. This has led to the implementation of task-shifted interventions, in which specific tasks are moved away from highly qualified health workers to health workers with less training. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published recommendations for such interventions, but guidelines for software and systems supporting such interventions are not included., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to formulate a number of software requirements for computer systems supporting task-shifted interventions. As the treatment of mental health problems is generally considered to be a task for highly trained health care professionals, it poses interesting case studies for task-shifted interventions. Therefore, we illustrated the use of the identified software requirements in a mobile system created for a task-shifted depression intervention to be provided to older adults in deprived areas of Sao Paulo, Brazil., METHODS: Using a set of recommendations based on the WHO's guidance documentation for task-shifted interventions, we identified 9 software requirements that aim to support health workers in management and supervision, training, good relationship with other health workers, and community embeddedness of the intervention. These 9 software requirements were used to implement a system for the provision of a psychosocial depression intervention with mobile Android interfaces to structure interventions and collect data, and Web interfaces for supervision and support of the health care workers delivering the intervention. The system was tested in a 2-arm pilot study with 33 patients and 11 health workers. In all, 8 of these 11 health workers participated in a usability study subsequent to the pilot., RESULTS: The qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained with the System Usability Scale suggest that the system was deemed to have a usability of between OK and Good. Nevertheless, some participants' responses indicated that they felt they needed technical assistance to use the system. This was reinforced by answers obtained with perceived usefulness and ease of use questionnaires, which indicated some users felt that they had issues around correct use of the system and perceived ability to become skillful at using the system., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these high-level requirements adequately captured the functionality required to enable the health workers to provide the intervention successfully. Nevertheless, the analysis of results indicated that some improvements were required for the system to be useable in a task-shifted intervention. The most important of these were better access to a training environment, access for supervisors to metadata such as duration of sessions or exercises to identify issues, and a more robust and human-error-proof approach to the availability of patient data on the mobile devices used during the intervention.

  abstract = {Mental healthcare is largely unavailable throughout Haiti, particularly in rural areas. The aim of the current study is to explore perceived feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of potential culturally adapted interventions to improve mental health among Haitian women. The study used focus group discussions (n = 12) to explore five potential interventions to promote mental health: individual counseling, income-generating skills training, peer support groups, reproductive health education, and couples' communication training. Findings indicate that individual counseling, support group, and skills training components were generally anticipated to be effective, acceptable, and feasible by both male and female participants. That being said, participants expressed doubts regarding the acceptability of the couples' communication training and reproductive health education due to: a perceived lack of male interest, traditional male and female gender roles, lack of female autonomy, and misconceptions about family planning. Additionally, the feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability of the components were described as dependent on cost, proximity to participants, and inclusion of a female health promoter that is known in the community. Given the lack of research on intervention approaches in Haiti, particularly those targeting mental health, this study provides a foundation for developing prevention and treatment approaches for mental distress among Haitian women.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces, describes and analyses the emerging concept of Global Mental Health (GMH). The birth of GMH can be traced to London, 2007, with the publication of a series of high-profile papers in The Lancet. Since then, GMH has developed into a movement with proponents, adherents, opponents, an ideology and core activities. The stated aims of the Movement for GMH are 'to improve services for people living with mental health problems and psychosocial disabilities worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries where effective services are often scarce'. GMH could be considered an attempt to right a historic wrong. During the colonial and post-colonial eras, the mental health of subject populations was accorded a very low priority. This was fuelled by scientific racism, which alleged that mental illness was uncommon in places such as Africa. As developing nations have made the epidemiological transition, the burden of mental illness has proportionately increased, with research suggesting a massive 'treatment gap' between those in need and those actually receiving formal mental health care. As such, much GMH research and action has been devoted to: (i) the identification and scale-up of cost-effective evidence-supported interventions that could be made more widely available; (ii) task-shifting of such intervention delivery to mental-health trained non-specialist Lay Health Workers. GMH has come under sustained critique. Critics suggest that GMH is colonial medicine come full circle, involving the top-down imposition of Western psychiatric models and solutions by Western-educated elites. These critiques suggest that GMH ignores the various indigenous modalities of healing present in non-Western cultures, which may be psychologically adaptive and curative. Relatedly, critics argue that GMH could be an unwitting Trojan horse for the mass medicalisation of people in developing countries, paving the way for exploitation by Big Pharma, while ignoring social determinants of health.},

  abstract = {The global mental health treatment gap has increasingly been addressed using task-shifting; however, very little research has focused on lay counselors' perspectives on the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of mental health interventions in specific government-supported sectors that might scale up and sustain mental health care for children and adolescents. In western Kenya, these sectors include Education and Health. Data come from a large hybrid effectiveness-implementation study examining implementation practices and policies in either or both sectors that support successful implementation of a child-focused intervention, Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), for children and adolescents who had experienced parental death. We examined lay counselors' self-report of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of TF-CBT. Lay counselors were teachers (n = 30) from the Education sector and Community Health Volunteers (CHVs; n = 30) from the Health sector, who were part of Sequence 1 of a large stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial. Lay counselor self-report surveys included reflective and formative measurement of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness administered after lay counselors in both sectors had experience delivering the locally-adapted, group-based TF-CBT intervention. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) were used to understand counselors' perspectives stratified by sector. Both teachers and CHVs endorsed high acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of TF-CBT, with lay counselors' responses on items from the formative measures providing some insight into specific aspects of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness that may be important to consider when planning for implementation support. These early findings suggest that both sectors may hold promise for task-shifting of mental health care for children and adolescents but also underline the importance of considering the multiple facets of these three implementation outcomes as well as lay counselor context (Education vs. Health).

Task-shifting has been used to address the shortage of mental health professionals, with a growing body of research demonstrating the effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered through task-shifting. However, very little research has focused on how to embed, support, and sustain task-shifting in government-funded systems with potential for scale up. The goal of the Building and Sustaining Interventions for Children (BASIC) study is to examine implementation policies and practices that predict adoption, fidelity, and sustainment of a mental health intervention in the education sector via teacher delivery and the health sector via community health volunteer delivery., METHODS: BASIC is a Hybrid Type II Implementation-Effectiveness trial. The study design is a stepped wedge, cluster randomized trial involving 7 sequences of 40 schools and 40 communities surrounding the schools. Enrollment consists of 120 teachers, 120 community health volunteers, up to 80 site leaders, and up to 1280 youth and one of their primary guardians. The evidence-based mental health intervention is a locally adapted version of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, called Pamoja Tunaweza. Lay counselors are trained and supervised in Pamoja Tunaweza by local trainers who are experienced in delivering the intervention and who participated in a Train-the-Trainer model of skills transfer. After the first sequence completes implementation, in-depth interviews are conducted with initial implementing sites' counselors and leaders. Findings are used to inform delivery of implementation facilitation for subsequent sequences' sites. We use a mixed methods approach including qualitative comparative analysis to identify necessary and sufficient implementation policies and practices that predict 3 implementation outcomes of interest: adoption, fidelity, and sustainment. We also examine child mental health outcomes and cost of the intervention in both the education and health sectors., DISCUSSION: The BASIC study will provide knowledge about how implementation of task-shifted mental health care can be supported in government systems that already serve children and adolescents. Knowledge about implementation policies and practices from BASIC can advance the science of implementation in low-resource contexts., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03243396.

  abstract = {Background: Epilepsy remains the most frequent diagnosis in Psychiatric and Mental Health Services in Mozambique. Because it is a major concern, in 2013 a Program for "Reducing the Epilepsy Treatment gap" was launched in 16 districts of five provinces covering a population of over 1.9 million. Using the WHO Mental Health Gap Program (mhGAP), a pilot Program was developed to provide effective quality care and treatment for people with epilepsy at primary health care level. Implementation was against a background of a shortage of human resources trained to address epilepsy and difficulties in the availability of antiepileptic medicines., Methods: The first step for implementation was advocacy from the Government level to relevant stakeholders in the community. mhGAP training materials were translated and adapted to the local context. Non-specialists health providers and community health workers were trained and supervised regularly. Population awareness raising and community involvement were key for acceptance of the Program., Results: After 4 years of implementation, 177 health professionals and 1161 community health workers were trained and ensured services delivery for people living with epilepsy (PwE). The implementation led to 89,869 consultations, representing an increase of 67% since the Program's inception. From 2015 to 2017 a total of 13,563 new cases were attended and the treatment gap was reduced from 99 to 96%. More than 60% of the new cases are children and adolescents. Awareness actions reached more than 14,000 people per year using all available broadcast means. Preliminary positive results were used as evidence for the Ministry of Health (MoH) to increase the purchase of antiepileptic drugs and improve delivery at district level., Discussion: mhGAP is an important tool for reducing the treatment gap in low-income countries. Adapting guidelines to the country context and involving community stakeholders are key for Program sustainability. As in other settings, the strategy was cost-effective resulting in an increase in new cases and follow-up consultations., Conclusions: Implementation of an adapted mhGAP strategy and the involvement of community stakeholders and commitment of the MoH resulted in significant increase in the number of PwE attending outpatient services in primary health care facilities.},

A total of 160 participants who did not achieve viral suppression from their first-line ART and have a unipolar depressive mood disorder will be randomized to receive either 8 sessions of CBT-AD or enhanced treatment as usual. Participants will be assessed for major depressive disorder using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 months. The primary outcomes are depression on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D; as assessed by a blinded assessor) at the 4-month assessment and changes in ART adherence (assessed via real-time, electronic monitoring with Wisepill) between baseline and the 4-month assessment. Secondary outcomes are HIV viral load and CD4 cell count at the 12-month assessment as well as ART adherence (Wisepill) and depression (HAM-D) over follow-up (4-, 8-, and 12-month assessments)., RESULTS: The trial commenced in August 2015 and recruitment began in July 2016. Enrollment was completed in June 2019., CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will inform whether an existing intervention (CBT-AD) can be effectively administered in LMIC by nurses with training and ongoing supervision. This will present unique opportunities to further explore the scale-up of a behavioral intervention to enhance ART adherence among persons living with HIV with major depression in a high-prevalence setting, to move toward achieving The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 goals., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClincialTrials.gov NCT02696824; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02696824., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/14200.

This case series describes an integrated intervention for depression and ART adherence delivered by a lay adherence counselor and supervised by a local psychologist. The 6-session intervention was based on problem-solving therapy for depression and for barriers to adherence (PST-AD), with stepped care for those whose depression did not recover with PST-AD. Primary outcomes were acceptability and depression. Acceptability was measured by participant attendance to the 6 sessions. Three case studies illustrate the structured intervention, solutions identified to adherence barriers and to problems underlying low mood, and changes seen in the clients' psychological symptoms. Acceptability of the intervention was high and common mental disorder symptoms scores measured using the SRQ-8 decreased overall. An integrated intervention for depression and adherence to ART appeared feasible in this low-income setting. An RCT of the intervention versus an appropriate comparison condition is needed to evaluate clinical and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports the use of Western therapies for the treatment of depression, trauma, and stress delivered by community health workers (CHWs) in conflict-affected, resource-limited countries. A recent randomized controlled trial (Bolton et al. 2014a) supported the efficacy of two CHW-delivered interventions, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and brief behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD), for reducing depressive symptoms and functional impairment among torture survivors in the Kurdish region of Iraq., METHODS: This study describes the adaptation of the CHW-delivered BATD approach delivered in this trial (Bolton et al.2014a), informed by the Assessment-Decision-Administration-Production-Topical experts-Integration-Training-Testing (ADAPT-ITT) framework for intervention adaptation (Wingood & DiClemente, 2008). Cultural modifications, adaptations for low-literacy, and tailored training and supervision for non-specialist CHWs are presented, along with two clinical case examples to illustrate delivery of the adapted intervention in this setting., RESULTS: Eleven CHWs, a study psychiatrist, and the CHW clinical supervisor were trained in BATD. The adaptation process followed the ADAPT-ITT framework and was iterative with significant input from the on-site supervisor and CHWs. Modifications were made to fit Kurdish culture, including culturally relevant analogies, use of stickers for behavior monitoring, cultural modifications to behavioral contracts, and including telephone-delivered sessions to enhance feasibility., CONCLUSIONS: BATD was delivered by CHWs in a resource-poor, conflict-affected area in Kurdistan, Iraq, with some important modifications, including low-literacy adaptations, increased cultural relevancy of clinical materials, and tailored training and supervision for CHWs. Barriers to implementation, lessons learned, and recommendations for future efforts to adapt behavioral therapies for resource-limited, conflict-affected areas are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: A key focus of health systems strengthening in low- and middle-income countries is increasing reach and access through task-shifting. As such models become more common, it is critical to understand the experiences of lay providers because they are on the forefront for delivering care services. A greater understanding would improve lay provider support and help them provide high-quality care. This is especially the case for those providing mental health services, as providing psychological care may pose unique stressors. We sought to understand experiences of lay counselors, focusing on identity, motivation, self-efficacy, stress, and burnout. The goal was to understand how taking on a new provider role influences their lives beyond simply assuming a new task, which would in turn help identify actionable steps to improve interventions with task-shifting components., Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and focus group discussions (n = 3) were conducted with three lay counselor groups with varying levels of experience delivering a community-based family therapy intervention in Eldoret, Kenya. Thematic analysis was conducted, including intercoder reliability checks. A Stress Map was created to visualize stress profiles using free-listing and pile-sorting data collected during interviews and focus group discussions., Results: Counselors described high intrinsic motivation to become counselors and high self-efficacy after training. They reported positive experiences in the counselor role, with new skills improving their counseling and personal lives. As challenges arose, including client engagement difficulties and balancing many responsibilities, stress and burnout increased, dampening motivation and self-efficacy. In response, counselors described coping strategies, including seeking peer and supervisor support, that restored their motivation to persevere. At case completion, they again experienced high self-efficacy and a desire to continue., Conclusions: Findings informed suggestions for ways to incorporate support for lay providers into task-shifting interventions at initiation, during training, and throughout implementation. These include acknowledging and preparing counselors for challenges during training, increasing explicit attention to counselor stress in supervision, fostering peer support among lay providers, and ensuring a fair balance between workload and compensation. Improving and building an evidence base around practices for supporting lay providers will improve the effectiveness and sustainability of lay provider-delivered interventions.

There is concern, however, that this approach will exacerbate nurses' abuse of patients currently common within PHC in the country. To address this concern, the Perinatal Mental Health Project developed its Secret History method, a critical pedagogical intervention for care-providers working within maternity settings. This article describes the method's theoretical underpinnings and practical application amongst nurses. Drawing on Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed and contrary to traditional nursing training in South Africa, the method creates a space for nurses to interrogate and reimagine nurse-patient relations. By introducing nurses to a counter ideology of empathic care, the method seeks to prepare the maternity environment for mental health task-shifting initiatives and ensure these initiatives are more democratic, responsive and humane.},

However, access to adequate mental health care in host countries is limited. The WHO has developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a brief, scalable psychological intervention, delivered by non-specialist helpers, that addresses common mental disorders in people affected by adversity. This study is part of the STRENGTHS project, that aims to evaluate peer-refugee delivered psychological interventions for Syrian refugees in Europe and the Middle East. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the peer-refugee delivered PM+ intervention among Syrian refugees with elevated levels of psychological distress in the Netherlands. Methods: PM+ will be tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among Arabic-speaking Syrian refugees in the Netherlands aged 18 years and above with self-reported psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; K10 >15) and impaired daily functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 >16). Participants (N = 380) will be randomized into care as usual with PM+ (CAU/PM+, n = 190) or CAU only (CAU, n = 190). Baseline, 1-week post-intervention, and 3-month and 12-month follow-up assessments will be conducted. Primary outcomes are symptoms of depression and anxiety. Secondary outcomes are functional impairment, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, self-identified problems, anger, health and productivity costs, and hair cortisol concentrations. A process evaluation will be carried out to evaluate treatment dose, protocol fidelity and stakeholder views on barriers and facilitators to implementing PM+. Results and Conclusions: PM+ has proved effectiveness in other populations and settings. After positive evaluation, the adapted manual and training materials for individual PM+ will be made available through the WHO to encourage further replication and scaling up.

  abstract = {Substance use is a major public health problem with a host of negative outcomes. Justice-involved youth have even higher risks and lack access to evidence-based interventions, particularly in rural communities. Task-shifting, or redistribution of tasks downstream to an existing workforce with less training, may be an innovative strategy to increase access to evidence-based interventions. Initial findings are presented from a services research trial conducted primarily in rural communities in which an existing workforce, juvenile probation/parole officers (JPOs), were randomized either to learn and deliver contingency management (CM) or to continue delivering probation services as usual (PAU). This study used the prevailing version of CM for adolescents, that is, family-based with behavior modification and cognitive behavioral components. Data included JPOs' self-reports, as well as audio-recorded youth/family sessions with JPOs rated by expert and trained observational coders. Data also included ratings from a comparison study in which therapists were trained and supervised by experts to deliver CM to justice-involved youth/families. Results showed JPOs can feasibly incorporate CM into their services. When adherence of CM JPOs was compared against CM therapists, JPOs delivered significantly more cognitive behavioral components of CM and similar levels of behavior modification components of CM. These findings suggest that JPOs can be leveraged to provide evidence-based substance use interventions like CM in similar, or even greater, capacities to clinically trained therapists. This task-shifting approach could dramatically expand service access for these high-risk youth, particularly in rural areas where substance use services are limited or nonexistent.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: At-birth and point-of-care (POC) HIV testing are emerging strategies to streamline infant HIV diagnosis and expedite ART initiation for HIV-positive infants. The purpose of this qualitative study was to evaluate factors influencing the provision and acceptance of at-birth POC testing among both HIV care providers and parents of HIV-exposed infants in Kenya., METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 HIV care providers and 35 parents of HIV-exposed infants (including 23 mothers, 6 fathers, and 3 mother-father pairs) at four study hospitals prior to POC implementation. An overview of best available evidence related to POC was presented to participants prior to each interview. Interviews probed about standard EID services, perceived benefits and risk of at-birth and POC testing, and suggested logistics of providing at-birth and POC. Interviews were audio recorded, translated (if necessary), and transcribed verbatim. Using the Transdisciplinary Model of Evidence Based Practice to guide analysis, transcripts were coded based on a priori themes related to environmental context, patient characteristics, and resources., RESULTS: Most providers (24/26) and parents (30/35) held favorable attitudes towards at-birth POC testing. The potential for earlier results to improve infant care and reduce parental anxiety drove preferences for at-birth POC testing. Parents with unfavorable views towards at-birth POC testing preferred standard testing at 6 weeks so that mothers could heal after birth and have time to bond with their newborn before-possibly-learning that their child was HIV-positive. Providers identified lack of resources (shortage of staff, expertise, and space) as a barrier., DISCUSSION: While overall acceptability of at-birth POC testing among HIV care providers and parents of HIV-exposed infants may facilitate uptake, barriers remain. Applying a task-shifting approach to implementation and ensuring providers receive training on at-birth POC testing may mitigate provider-related challenges. Comprehensive counseling throughout the antenatal and postpartum periods may mitigate patient-related challenges.},

Task-shifting brief mental health interventions to routine trauma center providers is an understudied but potentially critical part of the continuum of care. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of training trauma nurses to engage patients in patient-centered activity scheduling based on a Behavioral Activation paradigm, which is designed to counteract dysfunctional avoidance/withdrawal behavior common among patients after injury. Nurses (N = 4) and patients (N = 40) were recruited from two level II trauma centers. A portion of a one day in-person workshop included didactics, demonstrations, and experiential activities to teach brief intervention delivery. Nurses completed pre- and posttraining standardized patient role-plays prior to and two months after training, which were coded for adherence to the intervention. Nurses also completed exit interviews to assess their perspectives on the training and addressing patient mental health concerns. Findings support the feasibility of training trauma nurses in a brief mental health intervention. Task-shifting brief interventions holds promise for reaching more of the population in need of posttrauma mental health care.},

  abstract = {In the United States, the demand for child mental health services is increasing, while the supply is limited by workforce shortages. These shortages are unlikely to be corrected without significant structural changes in how mental health services are provided. One strategy for bridging this gap is task-shifting, defined as a process by which services that are typically delivered by professionals are moved to individuals with less extensive qualifications or training. Although task-shifting can increase the size of the workforce, there are challenges related to training new workers. In this paper, we propose Just-In-Time Training (JITT) as one strategy for improving task-shifting efforts. We define JITT as on-demand training experiences that only include what is necessary, when it is necessary, to promote competent service delivery. We offer a proof of concept from our own work shifting counseling and academic support tasks from school mental health professionals to pre-baccalaureate mentors, citing lessons learned during our iterative process of JITT development. We conclude with a series of key considerations for scaling up the pairing of task-shifting and JITT, including expanding the science of JITT and anticipating how task-shifting and JITT would work within the context of dynamic mental health service systems.

One potential solution involves utilizing task-shifting strategies and implementation science theoretical frameworks to implement such EBIs in CW settings. This study examined perceptions among CW staff who were members of a collaborative advisory board involved in the implementation of the 4Rs and 2Ss Strengthening Families Program (4R2S) in CW placement prevention settings, utilizing task-shifting strategies and the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model. Advisory board members reported difficulties in engaging families, heavy workloads, and conflicting implementation initiatives. While 4R2S was perceived as generally aligned with their organization's mission, modifications to the intervention and to agency procedures were recommended to promote implementation success.

  abstract = {There is a severe shortage of services for children with autism in Ethiopia; access to services is further impeded by negative beliefs and stigmatising attitudes towards affected children and their families. To increase access to services, care provision is decentralised through task-shifted care by community health extension workers. This study aimed to examine the impact of a brief training (Health Education and Training; HEAT) for Ethiopian rural health extension workers and comprised three groups: (1) health extension workers who completed a basic mental health training module (HEAT group, N = 104); (2) health extension workers who received enhanced training, comprising basic HEAT as well as video-based training on developmental disorders and a mental health pocket guide (HEAT+ group, N = 97); and (3) health extension workers untrained in mental health (N = 108). All participants completed a questionnaire assessing beliefs and social distance towards children with autism. Both the HEAT and HEAT+ group showed fewer negative beliefs and decreased social distance towards children with autism compared to the untrained health extension worker group, with the HEAT+ group outperforming the HEAT group. However, HEAT+ trained health extension workers were less likely to have positive expectations about children with autism than untrained health extension workers. These findings have relevance for task-sharing and scale up of autism services in low-resource settings worldwide.},

  abstract = {Overdose prevention sites (OPS) are a form of supervised consumption facility that have been implemented in Vancouver, Canada as an innovative response to an ongoing overdose epidemic. OPS are primarily staffed by peers - people who use(d) drugs (PWUD) - trained in overdose response. We sought to characterize peer worker involvement in OPS programming, including how this shapes service dynamics and health outcomes among PWUD. Data were drawn from a rapid ethnographic study examining the implementation, operations and impacts of OPS in Vancouver from December 2016 to April 2017. We conducted approximately 185h of observational fieldwork at OPS and 72 in-depth qualitative interviews with PWUD. Data were analyzed thematically, with a focus on peer worker involvement at OPS and related outcomes. OPS implementation and operations depended on peer worker involvement and thus allowed for recognition of capacities developed through roles that peers were already undertaking through local programming for PWUD. Peer involvement at OPS enhanced feelings of comfort and facilitated engagement with OPS among PWUD. These dynamics and appreciation of peer worker expertise enabled communication with staff in ways that fostered harm reduction practices and promoted health benefits. However, many peer workers received minimal financial compensation and experienced considerable grief due to the emotional toll of the epidemic and lack of supports, which contributed to staff burnout. Our findings illustrate the specific contributions of task shifting OPS service delivery to peer workers, including how this can enhance service engagement and promote the reduction of harms among PWUD. Amidst an ongoing overdose epidemic, expanding formalized peer worker involvement in supervised consumption programming may help to mitigate overdose-related harms, particularly in settings where peers are actively involved in existing programming. However, efforts are needed to ensure that peer workers receive adequate financial support and workplace benefits to promote the sustainability of this approach. Copyright © 2019.

  abstract = {The individual and social construction of psychological distress is fundamental to help-seeking and the extent to which interventions are seen as credible. Where pluralistic attributions for mental health problems predominate, the development of global mental health (GMH) interventions in the form of task-shifting approaches create increased access to new ways of understanding and responding to distress. However, little is known about how participants in these initiatives manage these encounters. This qualitative study in Malawi explored village-based health workers' (HSAs) and patients' and carers' views of the causes of distress and how these beliefs influenced help-seeking and the health workers' response.Eight HSAs and nine paired patients/carers were interviewed separately to enable each of nine experiences of distress to be explored. Findings revealed a complex set of personal, social and cultural influences that informed causative attributions and help-seeking decisions. Patients/carers viewed psychosocial stresses as compelling explanations and readily reported others attributing their distress to supernatural causes (bewitchment). Yet attributional beliefs alone were not the only influence over help-seeking, which evolved pragmatically in response to the impact of treatments and social pressure for conformity. In turn HSAs navigated the interactions with patients/carers by emphasising the biomedical approach and discrediting bewitchment attributions. This caused tensions when biomedical interventions were unhelpful or the traditional healers' approach proved beneficial. Conclusions add to the call for such task-shifting approaches to work with communities to discern authentic and practical responses to mental distress that mirror the 'pluralism and pragmatism' found in the communities they serve.},

This paper describes an Evidence Map of different strategies to strengthen the provision of mental health care at the primary health care (PHC) setting, the quality of the evidence, and knowledge gaps. Electronic and reference searching yielded 2666 articles of which 306 qualified for data extraction. A systematic review methodology identified nine different strategies that strengthen the provision of mental healthcare and these strategies are mapped in line with the outcomes they affect. The top three strategies that were reported the most, included strategies to empower families, carers and patients; integration of care or collaborative interventions; and e-health interventions. The least reported strategy was task shifting. The Evidence Map further shows the amount and quality of evidence supporting each of the listed strategies, and this helps to inform policy design and research priorities around mental health. This is the first systematic Evidence Map to show the different strategies that strengthen the provision of mental healthcare at PHC setting and the impact these strategies have on patient, hospital and societal level indicators.},

The objectives of this study were to assess the structure and process of pediatric BH integration and outcomes in patient experience (access and quality), cost, and provider satisfaction., METHODS: In 2013, we launched a multicomponent, transdiagnostic integrated BH model (Behavioral Health Integration Program [BHIP]) in a large pediatric primary care network in Massachusetts. Study participants comprised the first 13 practices to enroll in BHIP (Phase-1). Phase-1 practices are distributed across Greater Boston, with ~105 primary care practitioners serving ~114 000 patients. Intervention components comprised in-depth BH education, on-demand psychiatric consultation, operational support for integrated practice transformation, and on-site clinical BH service., RESULTS: Over 5 years, BHIP was associated with increased practice-level BH integration (P < .001), psychotherapy (P < .001), and medical (P = .04) BH visits and guideline-congruent medication prescriptions for anxiety and depression (P = .05) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (P = .05). Total ambulatory BH spending increased by 8% in constant dollars over 5 years, mainly attributable to task-shifting from specialty to primary care. Although an initial decline in emergency BH visits from BHIP practices was not sustained, total emergency BH spending decreased by 19%. BHIP providers reported high BH self-efficacy and professional satisfaction from BHIP participation., CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that integrating BH in the pediatric setting can increase access to quality BH services while engendering provider confidence and satisfaction and averting substantial increases in cost.

  abstract = {The explicit inclusion of mental health within the Sustainable Development Goals is a welcome development, borne out of powerful advocacy using public health, economic and human rights arguments. As funding comes on line for scale-up of evidence-based mental health care by task-sharing with primary care, it is time to take stock about care for people affected by severe mental illness (SMI). The existing evidence base for task shared care for SMI provides an imperative to get started, but is skewed towards relatively more affluent and urban populations in middle-income countries where specialist mental health professionals provide most of the care. Randomised, controlled trials and rigorous implementation research on task shared service models are underway which will go some way to improving understanding of the quality, safety, effectiveness and acceptability of more widely generalisable care for people with SMI. A sub-group of people with SMI have more complex and long-term needs for care, with a high risk of homelessness, imprisonment and human rights violations as family and social supports become overwhelmed. Case studies from non-governmental organisations provide examples of holistic approaches to rehabilitation, recovery and empowerment of people with SMI, but rigorous comparative studies are needed to identify the most efficient, effective and scalable approaches to care. Health system constraints are emerging as the over-riding barriers to successful task-sharing, highlighting a need to develop and evaluate chronic care models for people with SMI that succeed in reducing premature mortality, improving wellbeing and achieving better social outcomes. Addressing these evidence gaps is essential if task-sharing mental health care is going to deliver on its promise of promoting recovery for the full range of people affected by SMI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study is built on a long-standing research partnership between the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health and the White Mountain Apache Tribe to identify effective interventions to prevent suicide and promote resilience among American Indian (AI) youth. The work is founded on a tribally-mandated, community-based suicide surveillance system with case management by local community mental health specialists (CMHSs) who strive to connect at-risk youth to treatment and brief, adjunctive interventions piloted in past research., METHODS: Our primary aim is to evaluate which brief interventions, alone or in combination, have the greater effect on suicide ideation (primary outcome) and resilience (secondary outcome) among AI youth ages 10-24 ascertained for suicide-related behaviors by the tribal surveillance system. We are using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial with stratified assignment based on age and suicidal-behavior type, and randomizing N = 304 youth. Brief interventions are delivered by AI CMHSs, or by Elders with CMHS support, and include: 1) New Hope, an evidence-based intervention to reduce immediate suicide risk through safety planning, emotion regulation skills, and facilitated care connections; and 2) Elders' Resilience, a culturally-grounded intervention to promote resilience through connectedness, self-esteem and cultural identity/values. The control condition is Optimized Case Management, which all study participants receive. We hypothesize that youth who receive: a) New Hope vs. Optimized Case Management will have significant reductions in suicide ideation; b) Elders' Resilience vs. Optimized Case Management will have significant gains in resilience; c) New Hope followed by Elders' Resilience will have the largest improvements on suicide ideation and resilience; and d) Optimized Case Management will have the weakest effects of all groups. Our secondary aim will examine mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness and sequencing., DISCUSSION: Due to heterogeneity of suicide risk/protective factors among AI youth, not all youth require the same types of interventions. Generating evidence for what works, when it works, and for whom is paramount to AI youth suicide prevention efforts, where rates are currently high and resources are limited. Employing Native paraprofessionals is a means of task-shifting psychoeducation, culturally competent patient support and continuity of care., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials NCT03543865, June 1, 2018.},

  abstract = {Several Latin American countries have made remarkable strides towards offering community mental health care for people with psychoses. Nonetheless, mental health clinics generally have a very limited outreach in the community, tending to have weaker links to primary health care; rarely engaging patients in providing care; and usually not providing recovery-oriented services. This paper describes a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Critical Time Intervention-Task Shifting (CTI-TS) aimed at addressing such limitations. The pilot RCT was conducted in Santiago (Chile) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). We included 110 people with psychosis in the study, who were recruited at the time of entry into community mental health clinics. Trial participants were randomly divided into CTI-TS intervention and usual care. Those allocated to the intervention group received usual care and, in addition, CTI-TS services over a 9-month period. Primary outcomes include quality of life (WHO Quality of Life Scale - Brief Version) and unmet needs (Camberwell Assessment of Needs) at the 18-month follow-up. Primary outcomes at 18 months will be analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), with observations clustered within sites. We will use three-level multilevel models to examine time trends on the primary outcomes. Similar procedures will be used for analyzing secondary outcomes. Our hope is that this trial provides a foundation for planning a large-scale multi-site RCT to establish the efficacy of recovery-oriented interventions such as CTI-TS in Latin America.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Latin America, and Chile in particular, has a rich tradition of community mental health services and programs. However, in vivo community-based psychosocial interventions, especially those with a recovery-oriented approach, remain scarce in the region. Between 2014 and 2015, a Critical Time Intervention-Task Shifting project (CTI-TS) was implemented in Santiago, Chile, as part of a larger pilot randomized control trial. CTI is a time-limited intervention delivered at a critical-time to users, is organized by phases, focuses on specific objectives and decreases in intensity over time. CTI-TS, which combines both the task-shifting strategy and the use of peers, introduces a novel approach to community mental health care that has not yet been tried in Chile., AIMS: We aim to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and applicability of such a community-based psychosocial intervention in urban settings in Latin America - specifically, in Santiago (Chile) from a user perspective., METHOD: We analyzed 15 in-depth interviews ( n = 15) with service users who participated in the intervention about their perceptions and experiences with CTI-TS through thematic analysis., RESULTS: Three themes were revealed. The first was related to the structural characteristics of CTI-TS, especially regarding the timing, duration and phasic nature of the intervention. The second pertained to the acceptability of the in vivo community-based approach. The third theme dealt with the task-shifting aspect, that is, users' perceptions of the peer support workers and the community mental health workers., CONCLUSIONS: CTI-TS was generally acceptable in this Latin American context. Users' perspectives pointed to the need to make adjustments to some of the structural characteristics of the CTI model and to combine this type of intervention with others that can address stigma. Thus, future adaptations of CTI-TS or similar psychosocial interventions in Latin American contexts are feasible and can enhance community mental health in the region.},

In addition, studies were assessed for their methodological quality using the framework established by Liu et al (2016)., RESULTS: 29 studies with relevant training courses met the inclusion criteria. These were implemented across 16 countries since 2008 (over half between 2014 and 2017), with 10 in three high-income countries. Evaluation methods and outcomes showed high variability across studies, with courses assessing trainees' attitude, knowledge, clinical practice, skills, confidence, satisfaction and/or patient outcome. All 29 studies found some improvement after training in at least one area, and 10 studies found this improvement to be significant., CONCLUSIONS: Training non-specialist workers in mental healthcare is an effective strategy to increase global provision and capacity, and improves knowledge, attitude, skill and confidence among health workers, as well as clinical practice and patient outcome. Areas for future focus include the development of standardised evaluation methods and outcomes to allow cross-comparison between studies, and optimisation of course structure., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016033269.

This qualitative study used exit interviews to examine participants' experiences of an adapted cognitive-behavioural therapy treatment for adherence and depression, task-shifted and delivered by nurses in two peri-urban HIV clinics near Cape Town. Nine semi-structured exit interviews were conducted with isiXhosa-speaking females and analysed using thematic analysis. Overall, participants responded positively to the treatment, viewing it as acceptable and beneficial and as a catalyst to returning to normalcy. Results indicated that participants viewed the treatment as being effective in ameliorating their depressive symptoms and improving their adherence to ART . Additional benefits described included improvements in subjective wellbeing and social and occupational functioning. Several began or resumed employment, an important behavioural indicator of the treatment's capacity to facilitate positive change and cost saving. Recommendations to improve the treatment included using video material and educating others about depression. These findings have positive implications regarding the acceptability and cultural applicability of the treatment for use in South Africa.},

  abstract = {Highly efficacious direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is largely inaccessible to communities facing a shortage of available specialist providers. Though less demanding than previous interferon regimens, DAA therapy requires patients to adhere to 8-12 weeks of daily treatment, which can be challenging for some patient populations. Duffy Health Center, located on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, provides integrated medical, mental health and case management services to people who are homeless or at risk for homelessness. The goal of this manuscript is to evaluate the outcomes of treatment of HCV infection with a shared medical appointment (SMA) model. The primary outcome was sustained virologic response (SVR-12), or HCV RNA <= 15 IU/mL at 12 weeks post-treatment. There were 102 patients recruited, with a total of 104 treatments administered. Over three-fourths of patients who attended one SMA visit (78 of 102) continued in SMA for the duration of treatment. Of these patients opting for SMA, 99% (77 of 78) completed the full treatment course, and 91% (71 of 78) of SMA patients achieved SVR-12. DAA therapy provided by non-specialist providers using the SMA model yielded comparable response rates to those achieved by specialist providers, and has the potential to substantially increase access to HCV treatment for patient populations within high-risk communities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In response to the lack of coverage for substance use treatment in the Western Cape province of South Africa, the local government expanded funding for evidence-based practices (EBPs) for treating substance use. Yet, little is known about provider and staff attitudes towards adopting EBPs in this setting, which is particularly relevant in this context where task shifting clinical care increases demands on paraprofessional providers. This study aimed to (1) assess attitudes towards adopting EBPs among a range of staff working in substance use treatment in Cape Town using a task shifting model; and (2) evaluate factors associated with openness towards adopting EBPs in this setting., METHODS: Staff (n = 87) were recruited from 11 substance use treatment clinics. Demographics and job-related characteristics were assessed. Staff perceptions of organizational factors were assessed using the TCU Organizational Readiness for Change (ORC) scale. The dependent variable, attitudes towards adopting EBPs, was assessed using the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS)., RESULTS: This study is one of the first to administer the EBPAS in South Africa and found good internal consistency (total score: alpha = .82). In a multivariable model adjusting for site and factors associated with EBPAS total score at the bivariate level, only smaller caseload size was associated with greater openness to adopting EBPs (B = 1.61, SE = .73; t = 2.21; p<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: As pressure to scale up implementation of EBPs in South African substance use treatment services intensifies, additional efforts are needed to understand barriers to adopt EBPs in this setting. Supporting staff adoption of EBPs in resource-limited settings may require additional resources to limit staff caseloads in the context of task shifting.},

As mental health disorders such as depression are prevalent among people living with HIV, investment in understanding and addressing comorbid depression is increasing. This manuscript aims to assess depression and HIV management in sub-Saharan Africa using a 90-90-90 lens through a discussion of: depression and the HIV care continuum; the state of depression screening and treatment; and innovations such as task-shifting strategies for depression management. Due to the lack of mental health infrastructure and human resources, task-shifting approaches that integrate mental health management into existing primary and community health programs are increasingly being piloted and adopted across the region. Greater integration of such mental health care task-shifting into HIV programs will be critical to realizing the 90-90-90 goals and ending the HIV epidemic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression, prevalent among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Malawi, is associated with negative HIV patient outcomes and likely affects HIV medical management. Despite the high prevalence of depression, its management has not been integrated into HIV care in Malawi or most low-income countries., METHODS: This study employs a pre-post design in two HIV clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi, to evaluate the effect of integrating depression management into routine HIV care on both mental health and HIV outcomes. Using a multiple baseline design, this study is examining mental health and HIV outcome data of adult (>=18 years) patients newly initiating ART who also have depression, comparing those entering care before and after the integration of depression screening and treatment into HIV care. The study is also collecting cost information to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the program in improving rates of depression remission and HIV treatment engagement and success., DISCUSSION: We anticipate that the study will generate evidence on the effect of depression management on HIV outcomes and the feasibility of integrating depression management into existing HIV care clinics. The results of the study will inform practice and policy decisions on integration of depression management in HIV care clinics in Malawi and related settings, and will help design a next-step strategy to scale-up integration to a larger scale., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID [ NCT03555669 ].

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence supporting the effectiveness of task-shifted mental health interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, there has been limited systematic scale-up or sustainability of these programs, indicating a need to study implementation. One barrier to progress is a lack of locally relevant and valid implementation measures. We adapted an existing brief dissemination and implementation (D&I) measure which includes scales for acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and accessibility for local use and studied its validity and reliability among a sample of consumers in Ukraine., METHODS: Local qualitative data informed adaptation of the measure and development of vignettes to test the reliability and validity. Participants were veterans and internally displaced persons (IDPs) recruited as part of a separate validity study of adapted mental health instruments. We examined internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and construct and criterion validity for each scale on the measure. We randomly assigned half the participants to respond to a vignette depicting existing local psychiatric services which we knew were not well regarded, while the other half was randomized to a vignette describing a potentially more well-implemented mental health service. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing scores on each scale by vignette and by overall summary ratings of the programs described in the vignettes., RESULTS: N = 169 participated in the qualitative study and N = 153 participated in the validity study. Qualitative findings suggested the addition of several items to the measure and indicated the importance of addressing professionalism/competency of providers in both the scales and the vignettes. Internal consistency reliabilities ranged from alpha = 0.85 for feasibility to alpha = 0.91 for appropriateness. Test-rest reliabilities were acceptable to good for all scales (rho: 0.61-0.79). All scales demonstrated substantial and significant differences in average scores by vignette assignment (ORs: 2.21-5.6) and overall ratings (ORs: 5.1-14.47), supporting criterion validity., CONCLUSIONS: This study represents an innovative mixed-methods approach to testing an implementation science measure in contexts outside the United States. Results support the reliability and validity of most scales for consumers in Ukraine. Challenges included large amounts of missing data due to participants' difficulties responding to questions about a hypothetical program.},

Unfortunately, the burden of CMDs is disproportionally substantial in women from low-income countries. Nevertheless, there is a growing recognition of the buffering effect of social support (SS) on psychiatric morbidity and the need for mental well-being support services/interventions. This study evaluated the relationship between psychiatric morbidity and SS levels, and factors influencing the mental health functioning of Zimbabwean women postnatally. Data were collected from 340 mothers and were analysed through structural equation modelling., RESULTS: The mothers' mean age was 26.6 (SD 5.6) years. The mean Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support score was 42.7 (SD 10.8), denoting high levels of SS. Additionally, 29.1% of the population reported excessive psychiatric morbidity, the median Shona Symptoms Questionnaire score was 5 (IQR: 2-8). The structural equation model demonstrated the buffering effects of SS on psychiatric morbidity (r = - 0.585, p = 0.01), and accounted for 70% of the variance. Being unmarried, increased maternal age, lower educational and income levels were associated with poorer maternal mental health. There is a need for routine; surveillance and treatment of CMDs in women in the postnatal period, including integration of low-cost, evidenced-based and task-shifting SS interventions.},

Recently, a new function (mental health nurses) and a new referral model for patients with mental health problems were introduced. AIM: To explore to what extent the volume of mental health care in Dutch general practices has increased and to what extent the content changed in the period 2010-2015. METHOD: This study employed: 1. analyses of medical records, and 2. a case study in a primary health care centre. RESULTS: The number of general practices with at least one mental health nurse increased from 20% in 2010 to almost 90% in 2015. In the period 2010-2014, general practitioners (gps) and mental health nurses treated increasing numbers of patients with mental health problems. No task shifting from gps to mental health nurses was observed. In the period 2011-2015, the number of antidepressant prescriptions increased slightly. In 2014, gps in a well-prepared primary care centre allocated 87% of their patients with mental health problems to a treatment setting in line with the referral model. CONCLUSION: Dutch general practices have recently provided more mental health care, thereby emphasising their important role in the mental health care system.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The importance of accessible mental health treatment is a global concern, particularly when one in five people will experience a mental health problem in their lifespan. This is no less important in Ghana; however, no studies have yet attempted to appraise and synthesise the potential enablers and barriers to accessing services in Ghana. The aim of this integrative review is therefore to identify and synthesise existing evidence on the barriers and enablers to accessing mental health services in Ghana., METHODS: A search of the published literature was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The search was limited to papers published in English and within 2000-2018. Using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved papers. A data extraction form and a Critical Appraisal Checklist were used to extract and appraise data, respectively. The integrative review incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data into a single synthesis., RESULTS: Out of 42 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 50% used qualitative methods, 33.3% used mixed methods and 16.7% used quantitative methods alone. The potential barriers in accessing mental health services were attitudinal, knowledge about services, treatment cost, transportation and geographical proximity, as well as perceived efficacy of medication. Similarly, the health systems factors contributing to barriers were low priority, limited funding sources, irregular medicine supply, limited services for marginalised groups and poor state of psychiatric facilities, together with poor management of mental health cadres. The potential enablers for service users involved increased decentralisation and integration, task-shifting and existing support services., CONCLUSION: The existing evidence on mental health in Ghana is skewed towards weaknesses in the systems and stigma, with rationally little, or no, evidence or emphasis on the effectiveness, or quality of mental health services. These attributes largely neglect the provision of psychiatric services for marginalised mental health service user groups, including children, adolescents, people with disabilities and the elderly.},

The primary aim of the study is to examine the effects of prolonged exposure therapy compared with supportive counseling for adolescents with PTSD delivered by nurses trained as counselors., METHODS/DESIGN: A single-blind randomized clinical trial comprising 90 adolescents with PTSD using a permuted block design will be utilized. Nurses previously naive to prolonged exposure and supportive counselling will be trained to provide these treatments at the adolescents' high schools. Data collection will last from March 2014 to December 2017 and annually thereafter, dependent on the availability of funding. Participants will receive seven to fourteen 60 min sessions of prolonged exposure treatment (n = 45) or supportive counselling (n = 45). All assessments will be conducted before treatment, at mid-treatment, immediately after treatment completion, at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, and annually thereafter. It is hypothesized that PE-A will be superior to SC in reducing PTSD symptoms at post-treatment as measured by the CPSS-I administered by an independent evaluator. It is further hypothesized that PE-A treatment gains will be maintained at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups and annually thereafter., DISCUSSION: While early indications are that PE-A is an effective treatment for PTSD in adolescents, this study will help determine the effectiveness of PE-A in a South African, community setting (school-based) when task-shifted to nurses, as compared to SC., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry: PACTR201511001345372 , retrospectively registered 11 November 2015.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) comprise half of the total regional population, yet existing mental health services are severely under-equipped to meet their needs. Although effective interventions for the treatment of disruptive behavioral disorders (DBDs) in youth have been tested in high-poverty and high-stress communities in developed countries, and are relevant for widespread dissemination in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), most of these evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been utilized in SSA, a region heavily impacted by poverty, diseases including HIV/AIDS, and violence. Thus, this paper presents a protocol for a scale-up longitudinal experimental study that uses a mixed-methods, hybrid type II, effectiveness implementation design to test the effectiveness of an EBP, called Multiple Family Group (MFG) aimed at improving child behavioral challenges in Uganda while concurrently examining the multi-level factors that influence uptake, implementation, sustainment, and youth outcomes., METHODS: The MFG intervention will be implemented and tested via a longitudinal experimental study conducted across 30 public primary schools located in both semi-urban and rural communities. The schools will be randomly assigned to three study conditions (n = 10 per study condition): (1) MFG delivered by trained family peers; (2) MFG delivered by community health workers; or; (3) comparison: usual care comprising mental health care support materials, bolstered with school support materials. A total of 3000 children (ages 8 to 13 years; grades 2 to 7) and their caregivers (N = 3000 dyads); 60 parent peers, and 60 community health workers will be recruited. Each study condition will comprise of 1000 child-caregiver dyads. Data will be collected at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks, and 6-month follow-up., DISCUSSION: This project is the first to test the effectiveness of the MFG intervention while concurrently examining multi-level factors that influence overall implementation of a family-based intervention provided in schools and aimed at reaching the large child population with mental health service needs in Uganda. Moreover, the study draws upon an EBP that has already been tested for delivery by parent peers and community facilitators, and hence will take advantage of the advancing science behind task-shifting. If successful, the project has great potential to address global child mental health needs., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03081195 . Registered on 16 March 2017.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Malawi, early retention in HIV care remains challenging. Depression is strongly associated with reduced anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression. Appropriate depression care for people initiating ART is likely to be supportive of early and continued engagement in the HIV care continuum. This paper aims to provide an overview of a task-shifting program that integrates depression screening and treatment into HIV care and the strategy used to evaluate this program, describes the implementation process, and discusses key challenges and lessons learned in the first phase of program implementation., METHODS: We are implementing a program integrating depression screening and treatment into HIV care initiation at two clinics in Lilongwe District, Malawi. The program's effect on patients' depression and HIV outcomes will be evaluated using a multiple baseline pre-post study. In this manuscript, we draw from our experiences as program implementers and some of the quantitative data to describe the process of implementation and key lessons learned., RESULTS: We successfully implemented the screening phase of this program at both clinics; 88.3 and 93.2% of newly diagnosed patients have been screened for depression at each clinic respectively. 25% of enrolled patients reported symptoms of mild-to-severe depression and only 6% reported symptoms of moderate-to-severe depression. Key lessons learned from the process show the importance of utilizing existing processes and infrastructure and focusing on iterative and collaborative learning. We continued to face challenges around establishing a sense of program ownership among providers, developing capacity to diagnose and manage depression, and ensuring the availability of appropriate medication. Our efforts to address these challenges provide insight into the technical and managerial support needed to prepare for, roll out, and sustain integrated models of mental health and HIV care., CONCLUSIONS: This activity demonstrates how a depression screening program can successfully be integrated into HIV care within the public health system in Malawi. While this program focuses on integrating depression management into HIV care, most of the lessons learned could apply to integration of mental health into any non-psychiatric specialist setting., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID [ NCT03555669 ].

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This investigation compared the perceived effectiveness of supportive counselling (SC) and prolonged exposure for adolescents (PE-A) by treatment users (adolescents with PTSD) and non-specialist treatment providers (supervised nurses)., METHOD: Adolescent participants and nurse providers were purposively recruited to share their experiences of trial participation through face to face semi-structured in-depth interviews and treatment-specific focus groups (all recorded). Twelve adolescent participant transcripts (ten interviews and two focus groups) and three nurse provider transcripts were doubly transcribed. Thematic content analysis was applied using Atlas.ti software. Two emerging themes are presented in this paper: 1) Perceptions of the intervention and 2) Usefulness of the intervention., RESULTS: Regardless of treatment arm, adolescents experienced warm counselling relationships and described the process of extending trust to the counselor. Adolescents in the PE-A arm provided clear descriptions of session structure and treatment rationale compared with adolescents receiving SC. The most helpful tools were breathing retraining and imaginal exposure for PE-A and creation of distraction strategies during non-directive SC. Adolescents in both arms continued to use the techniques acquired during treatment and reported symptom improvement. Participants who received SC acknowledged ongoing reexperiencing. Nurses perceived SC to be an immediately transferable skill, but feedback on their preference for one intervention over the other was inconclusive., CONCLUSION: Both PTSD treatment strategies, implemented by non-specialists, were perceived as helpful. Overall, adolescents reported warm therapeutic relationships and a reduction in PTSD symptoms. Nurses stated that they would require institutional support to ensure delivery of these interventions in a scalable and sustainable manner.},

Employing task-shifting and supervision, mental healthcare was largely delivered by trained, non-specialist health workers instead of specialists. A retrospective chart review of 318 unduplicated patients assessed and treated during the mobile clinic's first two years (January 2012 to November 2013) was conducted to explore outcomes. These data were supplemented by a quality improvement questionnaire, illustrative case reports, and a qualitative interview with the mobile clinic's lead community health worker. The team evaluated an average of 42 patients per clinic session. The most common mental, neurological, or substance abuse (MNS) disorders were depression and epilepsy. Higher follow-up rates were seen among those with diagnoses of bipolar disorder and neurological conditions, while those with depression or anxiety had lower follow-up rates. Persons with mood disorders who were evaluated on at least two separate occasions using a locally developed depression screening tool experienced a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. The mental health mobile clinic successfully treated a wide range of MNS disorders in rural Haiti and provided care to individuals who previously had no consistent access to mental healthcare. Efforts to address these common barriers to the provision of mental healthcare in resource-limited settings should consider supplementing clinic-based with mobile services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of trained mental health workers in spite of the significant contribution of psychiatric disorders to the global disease burden. Task shifting, through the delegation of health care tasks to less specialised health workers such as community health workers (CHWs), is a promising approach to address the human resource shortage. CHWs in the Western Cape province of South Africa provide comprehensive chronic support which includes that for mental illness, but have thus far not received standardized mental health training. It is unknown whether a structured mental health training programme would be acceptable and feasible, and result improved knowledge, confidence and attitudes amongst CHWs., METHODS: We developed and piloted a mental health training programme for CHWs, in line with the UNESCO guidelines; the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme and the South African National framework for CHW training. In our quasi-experimental (before-after) cohort intervention study we measured outcomes at the start and end of training included: 1) Mental health knowledge, measured through the use of case vignettes and the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule; 2) confidence, measured with the Mental Health Nurse Clinical Confidence Scale; and 3) attitudes, measured with the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill Scale. Knowledge measures were repeated 3 months later. Acceptability data were obtained from daily evaluation questionnaires and a training evaluation questionnaire, while feasibility was measured by participant attendance at training sessions., RESULTS: Fifty-eight CHWs received the training, with most (n = 56, 97.0%) attending at least 7 of the 8 sessions. Most participants (n = 29, 63.04%) demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge, which was sustained at 3-months. There was significant improvement in confidence, along with changes in attitude, indicating improved benevolence, reduced social restrictiveness, and increased tolerance to rehabilitation of the mentally ill in the community but there was no change in authoritarian attitudes. The training was acceptable and feasible., CONCLUSIONS: Mental health training was successful in improving knowledge, confidence and attitudes amongst trained CHWs. The training was acceptable and feasible. Further controlled studies are required to evaluate the impact of such training on patient health outcomes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: PACTR PACTR201610001834198 , Registered 26 October 2016.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite their high prevalence and significant burden, mental disorders such as depression remain largely underdiagnosed and undertreated., OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Allillanchu Project was to design, develop, and test an intervention to promote early detection, opportune referral, and access to treatment of patients with mental disorders attending public primary health care (PHC) services in Lima, Peru., METHODS: The project had a multiphase design: formative study, development of intervention components, and implementation. The intervention combined three strategies: training of PHC providers (PHCPs), task shifting the detection and referral of mental disorders, and a mobile health (mHealth) component comprising a screening app followed by motivational and reminder short message service (SMS) to identify at-risk patients. The intervention was implemented by 22 PHCPs from five health centers, working in antenatal care, tuberculosis, chronic diseases, and HIV or AIDS services., RESULTS: Over a period of 9 weeks, from September 2015 to November 2015, 733 patients were screened by the 22 PHCPs during routine consultations, and 762 screening were completed in total. The chronic diseases (49.9%, 380/762) and antenatal care services (36.7%, 380/762) had the higher number of screenings. Time constraints and workload were the main barriers to implementing the screening, whereas the use of technology, training, and supervision of the PHCPs by the research team were identified as facilitators. Of the 733 patients, 21.7% (159/733) screened positively and were advised to seek specialized care. Out of the 159 patients with a positive screening result, 127 had a follow-up interview, 72.4% (92/127) reported seeking specialized care, and 55.1% (70/127) stated seeing a specialist. Both patients and PHCPs recognized the utility of the screening and identified some key challenges to its wider implementation., CONCLUSIONS: The use of a screening app supported by training and supervision is feasible and uncovers a high prevalence of unidentified psychological symptoms in primary care. To increase its sustainability and utility, this procedure can be incorporated into the routine practices of existing health care services, following tailoring to the resources and features of each service. The early detection of psychological symptoms by a PHCP within a regular consultation, followed by adequate advice and support, can lead to a significant percentage of patients accessing specialized care and reducing the treatment gap of mental disorders.

The study is part of a pilot randomised controlled trial of an mHealth self-care intervention by nurses for women living with HIV in rural India. For the trial, 60 women were randomised to receive the mHealth intervention. All calls were recorded and call logs were maintained. Call logs of 59 women based on 1186 calls were scanned for psychosocial themes. Audio recordings of 400 calls rich in content were then transcribed and translated for analysis. Themes and subthemes were identified by two independent raters. Majority of the women had low literacy and more than half were widowed. Clinical depression was found in 18.6%. Of the 1186 call logs analysed, 932 calls had a record of at least one psychosocial concern and 493 calls recorded two psychosocial concerns. Some of the major themes that women discussed with nurses included worries about their own and their children's future; loneliness; stigma; inadvertent disclosure; death and dying; abandonment by partner; financial difficulties; body image; poor social support; emotions such as sadness, guilt, and anger; and need for social services. Almost all expressed appreciation for the intervention. Findings indicate the usefulness of mHealth-based self-care interventions delivered by nurses in hard to reach women in low- and middle-income countries, especially those with multiple psychosocial vulnerabilities.},

The practice-based perspectives of mental health providers may be particularly instructive. Existing foundational literature on the professional population in this region is scarce. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 mental health providers in northern Tanzania. Interviews focused on three topics: use of international diagnostic frameworks for mental illness, beliefs about causes of mental health concerns, and alternative treatments sought by clients. Interview data were coded and analyzed using consensual qualitative research and the constant comparative method. Usage of diagnostic frameworks varied widely. Providers believed frameworks accurately described many patients but neglected somatic symptoms and contained diagnoses that they had never witnessed. Providers described supernatural and spiritual attributions of mental illness as substantially impacting treatment decisions. Other notable attributions included physical illness, drug/alcohol use, and heredity. Providers reported their clients routinely sought treatment from traditional and spiritual healers prior to seeking care in the formal health system. This study builds a foundation for the ongoing development of the mental health system in northern Tanzania. Findings also support exploration of integrative models of care and task-shifting to incorporate traditional and spiritual beliefs.},

Relevant articles obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar searches are discussed. Studies indicate that PSWs can achieve outcomes equal to or better than those achieved by nonpeer mental health professionals. PSWs can be particularly effective in reducing hospital admissions and inpatient days and engaging severely ill patients. When certain care tasks are given to individuals with less training than professionals (task shifting), these staff members can provide psychoeducation, engage service users in treatment, and help them achieve symptom reduction and manage risk of relapse. Mental health first-aid and community organizations can reduce stigma, increase awareness of mental health issues, and encourage help seeking. Most PSW programs have reported implementation challenges, whereas such challenges are fewer in task-shifting programs and minimal in mental health first-aid. Despite challenges in scaling and integrating these approaches into larger systems, they hold promise for improving access to and quality of care. Research is needed on how these approaches can be combined to expand a community's capacity to provide care. Because of the serious shortage of mental health providers globally and the rising prevalence of mental illness, utilizing nontraditional providers may be the only solution in both low- and high-resource settings, at least in the short term.},

Models to improve access to BPT are needed, particularly those that can be readily implemented in community settings and that leverage the potential workforce to increase capacity to deliver BPT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a BPT model which included oft-used content, methods, processes of BPT (common-elements), non-professionally delivered (task-shifted/shared) BPT intervention, and an efficient ancillary support system (training, fidelity, and supervision methods) for families of youth with parental concerns about ADHD. In a randomized controlled trial of 161 families of children (79% male; mean age 7.04 [1.55]), the Caring in Chaos (CiC) BPT model, delivered by community volunteers across 12 community-based sites in Denmark, was compared to a wait-list control condition on key child and parent outcomes at immediate post-treatment and 4-month follow-up assessment points. Results suggested that the CiC model led to significantly greater improvement in parenting behavior, parenting sense of competence, child functional impairment, parental stress and parental depressive symptoms compared to the wait list condition at immediate post-treatment, with maintenance of gains in most of these areas at follow-up assessment. No effect of intervention was found on ADHD symptoms. The results of this study suggest that developing efficient BPT intervention models, such as the CiC model, can result in readily implemented interventions by a variety of individuals in community settings. Such models are necessary to bend the curve on addressing unmet needs of families of youth with concerns about ADHD.},

  abstract = {Engaging fathers and improving their parenting and, in turn, outcomes for their children in preventive/promotion-focused parenting interventions has been a notable, but understudied, challenge in the field. This study evaluated the effects of a novel intervention, Fathers Supporting Success in Preschoolers: A Community Parent Education Program, which focuses on integrating behavioral parent training with shared book reading (i.e., Dialogic Reading) using key conceptual models (i.e., common elements, deployment model, task shifting) to engage and improve father (i.e., male guardians) and child outcomes. One hundred twenty-six low-income, Spanish-speaking fathers and their children were recruited across three Head Start centers in urban communities and were randomized to the intervention or to a waitlist control condition. Outcomes were obtained before and immediately postintervention and included observed and father-reported parenting and child behaviors, standardized assessments of language, and father self-reported parental stress and depressive symptoms. Attendance data were also collected as a proxy measure of engagement to the intervention. Parenting behaviors (observed and father-reported), child behaviors (father-reported), and language development of the children in the intervention group improved significantly relative to those in the waitlist control condition. Effect sizes (ESs) were in the small to large range across outcomes. Fathers can be engaged in parenting interventions, resulting in improved parent and child outcomes. Greater attention must be given to methods for maximizing parenting within a family and toward developing effective, engaging, and sustainable intervention models for fathers.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Rural areas persistently face a shortage of mental health specialists. Task shifting, or task sharing, is an approach in global mental health that may help address unmet mental health needs in rural and other low-resource areas. This review focuses on task-shifting approaches and highlights future directions for research in this area., METHODS: Systematic review on task sharing of mental health care in rural areas of high-income countries included: (1) PubMed, (2) gray literature for innovations not yet published in peer-reviewed journals, and (3) outreach to experts for additional articles. We included English language articles published before August 31, 2013, on interventions sharing mental health care tasks across a team in rural settings. We excluded literature: (1) from low- and middle-income countries, (2) involving direct transfer of care to another provider, and (3) describing clinical guidelines and shared decision-making tools., FINDINGS: The review identified approaches to task sharing focused mainly on community health workers and primary care providers. Technology was identified as a way to leverage mental health specialists to support care across settings both within primary care and out in the community. The review also highlighted how provider education, supervision, and partnerships with local communities can support task sharing. Challenges, such as confidentiality, are often not addressed in the literature., CONCLUSIONS: Approaches to task sharing may improve reach and effectiveness of mental health care in rural and other low-resource settings, though important questions remain. We recommend promising research directions to address these questions. Copyright © 2017 National Rural Health Association.},

Acceptability of PST-AD was high, as indicated by frequency of session attendance and through qualitative analyses of exit interviews. Fidelity was >80% for the first two sessions of PST-AD but fidelity to the adherence component of PST-AD dropped by session 4. Contamination occurred, in that seven patients in the control arm received one or two PST-AD sessions before follow-up assessment. Routine health records proved unreliable for measuring HIV viral load at follow-up. Barriers to measuring adherence electronically included device failure and participant perception of being helped by the research device. The study was not powered to detect clinical differences, however, promising change at 6-months follow-up was seen in electronic adherence, viral load suppression (PST-AD arm 9/12 suppressed; control arm 4/8 suppressed) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-4.7 points in PST-AD arm vs. control, adjusted p value = 0.01). Results inform and justify a future randomised controlled trial of task-shifted PST-AD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The organisation of health assessments by preventive health services focusing on children's health and educational performance needs to be improved due to evolving health priorities such as mental health problems, reduced budgets and shortages of physicians and nurses. We studied the impact on the school professionals' perception of access to school health services (SHS) when a triage approach was used for population-based health assessments in primary schools. The triage approach involves pre-assessments by SHS assistants, with only those children in need of follow-up being assessed by a physician or nurse. The triage approach was compared with the usual approach in which all children are assessed by physicians and nurses., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, comparing school professionals' perceptions of the triage and the usual approach to SHS. The randomly selected school professionals completed digital questionnaires about contact frequency, the approachability of SHS and the appropriateness of support from SHS. School care coordinators and teachers were invited to participate in the study, resulting in a response of 444 (35.7%) professionals from schools working with the triage approach and 320 (44.6%) professionals working with the usual approach., RESULTS: Respondents from schools using the triage approach had more contacts with SHS and were more satisfied with the appropriateness of support from SHS than respondents in the approach-as-usual group. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of the perceived approachability of SHS., CONCLUSIONS: School professionals were more positive about access to SHS when a triage approach to routine assessments was in place than when the usual approach was used. Countries with similar population-based SHS systems could benefit from a triage approach which gives physicians and nurses more opportunities to attend schools for consultations and assessments of children on demand.},

Task-shifting interventions incorporating mobile health may improve adherence in mental health service users in low- and middle-income countries. Seventy-seven participants were recruited from a psychiatric hospital in Cape Town, with 42 randomized to receive the intervention and 35 to treatment as usual. Intervention pairs underwent treatment-partner contracting and psychoeducation, and received monthly text message reminders of clinic appointments. Primary outcomes were intervention acceptability and feasibility. Secondary outcome for efficacy were adherence to clinic visit; relapse; quality of life; symptomatic relief and medication adherence., RESULTS: Treatment partner and psychoeducation components were acceptable and feasible. The text message component was acceptable but not feasible in its current form. Efficacy outcomes favoured the intervention but did not reach statistical significance. A treatment-partner intervention is acceptable and feasible in a low- and middle-income setting. Work is needed to ensure that additional components of such interventions are tailored to the local context. Appropriately powered efficacy studies are needed.

This study aimed to gain preliminary evidence with regards to the efficacy and acceptability of OpenMinds: a peer-designed and facilitated mental health literacy programme for university and secondary school students. The programme involves a structured programme of education and training for university medical students, who then deliver workshops in secondary schools. Pre- and post-surveys were completed by 234 school students who received two workshops and 40 university medical students who completed the OpenMinds programme and delivered the workshops. The main outcomes in both groups were components of mental health literacy (non-stigmatising attitudes, knowledge, social distance and helping attitudes). Perceived teaching efficacy and interest in mental health careers (university medical students) and workshop acceptability (school students) were also examined. University and school student participation in OpenMinds was associated with significant improvements in three of four mental health literacy elements in both samples. Knowledge and attitudes improved in both samples, social distance improved only in the university sample and knowledge of helping behaviours increased in the school sample. University students' perceived teaching efficacy improved but there was no change in their reported interest in pursuing psychiatry in their career. Acceptability was high; over 70% of the school students agreed that they enjoyed the workshops and liked being taught by a university student. This study provides preliminary evidence for the acceptability and efficacy of OpenMinds as a sustainable peer-led model of mental health education for young people. The OpenMinds programme is ready for efficacy testing in a randomised trial.},

  abstract = {Although members of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies have made significant strides toward the collective goals outlined in our mission statement, we routinely acknowledge that our ability to develop empirically supported treatments exceeds our success in improving dissemination and implementation of said interventions. Further, as noted by Kazdin and Blase (2011), even if we succeeded in having every clinician worldwide administer our best treatments with excellent competency, we still would be unsuccessful in markedly impacting the worldwide burden of mental illness because most treatments require intensive labor by expensive providers. To this end, Kazdin and Blase and others call for increased use of alternative strategies. Examples include increased attention toward prevention; use of lower-cost, simplified interventions; task shifting; train-the-trainer models; community participatory research methodology; and identification of novel funding sources. The Body Project is an empirically supported, cognitive dissonance-based prevention intervention that targets body image, a well-established risk factor for eating disorders, negative affect, unhealthy weight control behaviors, smoking behavior, and decreased physical activity. Supported by a global village of researchers, community activists, and organizational partners, the Body Project is currently being implemented in 125 countries. The aim of this paper is to share lessons our team has learned in taking a prevention intervention from early testing to widespread implementation and connect these back to broader conversations occurring in our field regarding the importance of scalability and new directions in improving global mental health.

This study aims to examine the a new model for depression care in a low-resource environment compared to enhanced treatment at usual (E-TAU)., METHODS: We trained non-specialist community health workers (local lay employees of the public health system) to provide Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat depressive symptoms in the Brazilian, Sao Paulo city, family health strategy (FHS). We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 86 patients with a current major depressive disorder or dysthymia (based on DSM-IV) recruited from an FHS clinic. Participants were randomized to IPC intervention (n = 43) or E-TAU (n = 43). Participants allocated to IPC received 3-4 sessions provided by community health workers; research psychologists followed the E-TAU participants to facilitate their referral to specialized mental health care within the public system. Reduction of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); minor psychiatric symptomatology (including depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms) were measured using the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ); and functioning was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale over a 2-month period., RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant improvement on symptoms for both groups over 2 months, without significant differences between them. Per-protocol analysis showed significant better HDRS-17 outcomes for the IPC group., CONCLUSIONS: Training non-specialist community health workers in low- and middle-income countries to provide IPC could be a successful strategy in reducing the burden of depression and also potentially a low-cost and effective alternative to specialist-led services that might not be possible in low income settings., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Brazilian Clinical Trials, number RBR-5qhmb5 (trial url: http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-5qhmb5/) , retrospectively registered after May 1, 2013.},

  abstract = {Depression is globally the third-leading cause of disability in terms of disability-adjusted life-years. Depression in patients with diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, stroke or cardiovascular disease is 2-4-fold more prevalent than in people who do not have physical noncommunicable diseases, and may have a more prolonged course. The significant burden due to depression that is comorbid with chronic physical disease, coupled with limited resources, makes it a major public health challenge for low- and middle-income countries. Given the bidirectional relation between depression and chronic physical disease, the clear way forward in managing this population of patients is via a system in which mental health care is integrated with primary care. Central to this integrated approach is the Collaborative Care Model, adapted to the local sociocultural context. In this model, care is jointly led by the primary care physician, supported by a case manager and a mental health professional. Various successful initiatives in low- and middle-income countries may be used as templates for collaborative care in other low-resource settings. The model involves a range of interwoven components, such as capacity-building, task-sharing, task-shifting, developing good referral and linkage systems, anti-stigma initiatives and lifestyle modifications. Policies based on adoption of this approach would not only directly address depression that is comorbid with physical noncommunicable disease but also facilitate achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3, to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages".},

The primary data were obtained from key informant interviews with the clinical heads of 160 PRPHC facilities, while the secondary data comprised a literature review., RESULTS: The results indicate that psychiatrists are severely underrepresented, employed at a rate of 0.03 per 100 000 population in SA's PRPHC settings., CONCLUSIONS: Because of a lack of MH nurses and medical officers dedicated to MH in PRPHC facilities, recommendations are made that the current task shifting strategy be revisited to include more cadres of MH professionals with specialised psychopharmacological training, as non-medical prescribers at PRPHC level. It is advised that visiting psychiatrists and family physicians be involved in the construction of training and supervision programmes for non-medical prescribers at the primary healthcare level.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are one of the leading causes of disease and disability worldwide. In Vietnam, although epidemiological evidence suggests that depression rates are on par with global averages, services for depression are very limited. In a feasibility study that was implemented from 2013 to 2015, we found that a Supported Self-management (SSM) intervention showed promising results for adults with depression in the community in Vietnam. This paper describes the Mental Health in Adults and Children: Frugal Innovations (MAC-FI) trial protocol that will assess the effectiveness of the SSM intervention, delivered by primary care and social workers, to community-based populations of adults with depression in eight Vietnamese provinces., METHODS/DESIGN: The MAC-FI program will be assessed using a stepped-wedge, randomized controlled trial. Study participants are adults aged 18 years and over in eight provinces of Vietnam. Study participants will be screened at primary care centres and in the community by health and social workers using the Self-reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20). Patients scoring >7, indicating depression caseness, will be invited to participate in the study in either the SSM intervention group or the enhanced treatment as usual control group. Recruited participants will be further assessed using the World Health Organization's Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS 2.0) and the Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE) Questionnaire for alcohol misuse. Intervention-group participants will receive the SSM intervention, delivered with the support of a social worker or social collaborator, for a period of 2 months. Control- group participants will receive treatment as usual and a leaflet with information about depression. SRQ-20, WHODAS 2.0 and CAGE scores will be taken by blinded outcome assessors at baseline, after 1 month and after 2 months. The primary analysis method will be intention-to-treat., DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to add to the knowledge base about the effectiveness of a SSM intervention for adult depression that has been validated for the Vietnamese context. This trial will also contribute to the growing body of evidence about the effectiveness of low-cost, task-shifting interventions for use in low-resource settings, where specialist mental health services are often limited., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03001063 .

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 25% of the Indian population experience common mental disorders (CMD) but only 15-25% of them receive any mental health care. Stigma, lack of adequate mental health professionals and mental health services account for this treatment gap, which is worse in rural areas. Our project evaluated task shifting and mobile-technology based electronic decision support systems to enhance the ability of primary care health workers to provide evidence-based mental health care for stress, depression, and suicidal risk in 30 remote villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India., METHODS: The Systematic Medical Appraisal Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health project between May 2014 and April 2016 trained lay village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists - ASHAs) and primary care doctors to screen, diagnose and manage individuals with common mental disorders using an electronic decision support system. An anti-stigma campaign using multi-media approaches was conducted across the villages at the outset of the project. A pre-post evaluation using mixed methods assessed the change in mental health service utilization by screen positive individuals. This paper reports on the quantitative aspects of that evaluation., RESULTS: Training was imparted to 21 ASHAs and 2 primary care doctors. 5007 of 5167 eligible individuals were screened, and 238 were identified as being positive for common mental disorders and referred to the primary care doctors for further management. Out of them, 2 (0.8%) had previously utilized mental health services. During the intervention period, 30 (12.6%) visited the primary care doctor for further diagnosis and treatment, as advised. There was a significant reduction in the depression and anxiety scores between start and end of the intervention among those who had screened positive at the beginning. Stigma and mental health awareness in the broader community improved during the project., CONCLUSIONS: The intervention led to individuals being screened for common mental disorders by village health workers and increase in mental health service use by those referred to the primary care doctor. The model was deemed feasible and acceptable. The effectiveness of the intervention needs to be demonstrated using more robust randomized controlled trials, while addressing the issues identified that will facilitate scale up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among HIV+ patients, alcohol use is a highly prevalent risk factor for both HIV transmission and poor adherence to HIV treatment. The large-scale implementation of effective interventions for treating alcohol problems remains a challenge in low-income countries with generalized HIV epidemics. It is essential to consider an intervention's cost-effectiveness in dollars-per-health-outcome, and the long-term economic impact -or "return on investment" in monetary terms., METHODS: We conducted a cost-benefit analysis, measuring economic return on investment, of a task-shifted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to reduce alcohol use in a modeled cohort of 13,440 outpatients in Kenya. In our base-case, we estimated the costs and economic benefits from a societal perspective across a six-year time horizon, with a 3% annual discount rate. Costs included all costs associated with training and administering task-shifted CBT therapy. Benefits included the economic impact of lowered HIV incidence as well as the improvements in household and labor-force productivity. We conducted univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results., RESULTS: Under the base case, total costs for CBT rollout was $554,000, the value of benefits were $628,000, and the benefit-to-cost ratio was 1.13. Sensitivity analyses showed that under most assumptions, the benefit-to-cost ratio remained above unity indicating that the intervention was cost-saving (i.e., had positive return on investment). The duration of the treatment effect most effected the results in sensitivity analyses., CONCLUSIONS: CBT can be effectively and economically task-shifted to paraprofessionals in Kenya. The intervention can generate not only reductions in morbidity and mortality, but also economic savings for the health system in the medium and long term. The findings have implications for other countries with generalized HIV epidemics, high prevalence of alcohol consumption, and shortages of mental health professionals., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This paper uses data derived from "Cognitive Behavioral Treatment to Reduce Alcohol Use Among HIV-Infected Kenyans (KHBS)" with ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT00792519 on 11/17/2008; and preliminary data from "A Stage 2 Cognitive-behavioral Trial: Reduce Alcohol First in Kenya Intervention" ( NCT01503255 , registered on 12/16/2011).},

Because 90% of U.S. youth regularly see a PPC provider, the primary care setting is well positioned to serve as a key access point for early identification, service provision, and connection to mental health services. In the context of task shifting, we evaluated a quality improvement project designed to assist PPC providers in overcoming barriers to practice-wide mental health screening through implementing paper and computer-assisted clinical care algorithms. PPC providers were fairly successful at changing practice to better address mental health concerns when equipped with screening tools that included family mental health histories, next-level actions, and referral options. Task shifting is a promising strategy to enhance mental health services, particularly when guided by computer-assisted algorithms.

This study aims to determine the outcomes of using evidence-based mental health Global Action Programme Intervention guide (mhGAP-IG) to provide psychosocial interventions among depressed patients seeking care from THPs. THPs were trained to deliver psychosocial interventions to their patients screening positive for mild to severe depression on Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Assessments were conducted at 0, 6 and 12 weeks and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) performed to determine the change in depression scores over the three time period. BDI mean score was 26.52 before intervention and reduced significantly at 6 (13%) and 12 (35%) weeks after intervention. 58 and 78% of patients showed reduction in symptoms of depression at 6 and 12 weeks. It is therefore crucial to engage THPs in the care of patients with depression and the need for inclusion of training packages; and other mental disorders in order to establish and maintain collaboration between THPs and conventional health workers and promote evidence-based care among marginalized populations. Moreover, further research on randomized control trials of mhGAP-IG intervention versus usual care is required.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the immunological benefit of treatment and increases complications related to human immune-deficiency virus (HIV). However, the risk factors for ART discontinuation are poorly understood in developing countries particularly in Ethiopia. This review aimed to assess the best available evidence regarding risk factors for ART discontinuation in Ethiopia., METHODS: Quantitative studies conducted in Ethiopia between 2002 and 2015 that evaluated factors associated with ART discontinuation were sought across six major databases. Only English language articles were included. This review considered studies that included the following outcome: ART treatment discontinuation, i.e. 'lost to follow up', 'defaulting' and 'stopping medication'. Meta- analysis was performed with Mantel Haenszel method using Revman-5 software. Summary statistics were expressed as pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals at a p-value of <0.05., RESULTS: Nine (9) studies met the criteria of the search. Five (5) were retrospective studies, 3 were case control studies, and 1 was a prospective cohort study. The total sample size in the included studies was 62,156. Being rural dweller (OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.5-2.7, I2 = 60%), being illiterate (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1-2.1), being not married (OR = 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1-1.8), being alcohol drinker (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.9-4.4, I2 = 39%), being tobacco smoker (OR = 2.6, 95%CI: 1.6-4.3, I2 = 74%), having mental illness (OR = 2.7, 95%CI: 1.6-4.6, I2 = 0%) and being bed ridden functional status (OR = 2.3, 95%CI: 1.5-3.4, I2 = 37%) were risk factors for ART discontinuation. Whereas, having HIV positive partner (OR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.3-0.6, I2 = 69%) and being co-infected with Tb/HIV (OR = 0.6, 95%CI: 0.4-0.9, I2 = 0%) were protective factors., CONCLUSION: Demographic, behavioral and clinical factors influenced ART treatment discontinuation. Hence, we recommend strengthening decentralization of HIV care services in remote areas, strengthening of ART task shifting, application of seek-test-treat-succeed model, and integration of smoking cession strategies and mental health care into the routine HIV care program.},

  abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in developing psychosocial interventions for eating disorders and other mental disorders. Two priorities in providing treatment consist of addressing the research-practice gap and the treatment gap. The research-practice gap pertains to the dissemination of evidence-based treatments from controlled settings to routine clinical care. Closing the gap between what is known about effective treatment and what is actually provided to patients who receive care is crucial in improving mental health care, particularly for conditions such as eating disorders. The treatment gap pertains to extending treatments in ways that will reach the large number of people in need of clinical care who currently receive nothing. Currently, in the United States (and worldwide), the vast majority of individuals in need of mental health services for eating disorders and other mental health problems do not receive treatment. This article discusses the approaches required to better ensure: (1) that more people who are receiving treatment obtain high-quality, evidence-based care, using such strategies as train-the-trainer, web-centered training, best-buy interventions, electronic support tools, higher-level support and policy; and (2) that a higher proportion of those who are currently underserved receive treatment, using such strategies as task shifting and disruptive innovations, including treatment delivery via telemedicine, the Internet, and mobile apps.

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in developing evidence-based psychological interventions, substantial changes are needed in the current system of intervention delivery to impact mental health on a global scale (Kazdin & Blase, 2011). Prevention offers one avenue for reaching large populations because prevention interventions often are amenable to scaling-up strategies, such as task-shifting to lay providers, which further facilitate community stakeholder partnerships. This paper discusses the dissemination and implementation of the Body Project, an evidence-based body image prevention program, across 6 diverse stakeholder partnerships that span academic, non-profit and business sectors at national and international levels. The paper details key elements of the Body Project that facilitated partnership development, dissemination and implementation, including use of community-based participatory research methods and a blended train-the-trainer and task-shifting approach. We observed consistent themes across partnerships, including: sharing decision making with community partners, engaging of community leaders as gatekeepers, emphasizing strengths of community partners, working within the community's structure, optimizing non-traditional and/or private financial resources, placing value on cost-effectiveness and sustainability, marketing the program, and supporting flexibility and creativity in developing strategies for evolution within the community and in research. Ideally, lessons learned with the Body Project can be generalized to implementation of other body image and eating disorder prevention programs. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of mental health (MH) and substance abuse problems in low-to-middle income countries, the scarcity of MH professionals and the negative impact of psychiatric disorders on caregivers of young children, there is significant need for brief evidence-based screening tools for lay counselors to assist with MH assessment. This study aimed to validate a brief screening tool to assess psychiatric and substance use disorders, the Client Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), in South Africa (SA)., METHODS: Data are from a longitudinal study of health and psychosocial needs in preschool children in SA. Participants included 322 Zulu-speaking, female caregivers. Following procedures of the US CDQ validation study, lay counselors interviewed participants using the translated Zulu CDQ. Subsequently a psychologist conducted a full psychiatric assessment guided by the CDQ questions. Analyses examined sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy, comparing lay counselor and psychologist assessment., RESULTS: Sensitivity (73%), specificity (81%) and overall accuracy (79%) were good for the variable indicating presence of 'any diagnosis.' Among those cases identified by the psychologist as having any psychiatric diagnosis, over 70% were correctly identified by lay counselors using the CDQ (i.e., positive predictive value was greater than 70%). The false positive rate was relatively low (19%). Specificity for 'any disorder' (including substance use) and 'any psychiatric disorder' were 81% and 79%., CONCLUSIONS: The isiZulu CDQ is a sensitive and valid MH diagnostic screener that can be used by lay counselors with limited MH training to identify those in need of treatment and target extremely scarce MH professionals. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: South Africa (SA), a country heavily impacted by poverty, HIV and the legacy of Apartheid, has a high prevalence of mental health (MH) and substance abuse problems. In SA and other low-and-middle-income-countries (LMIC) there is a dearth of MH professionals. This study examined use and validity of the Client Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), a brief diagnostic MH screening tool designed for use by lay counselors in HIV-affected populations. Comparing lay counsellor diagnoses on the CDQ to clinician assessment, sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy were good at the level of 'any diagnosis.' The CDQ can be used effectively in SA and other LMIC with limited MH services to enable appropriate and efficient referral of individuals in primary care settings, supporting caregivers and the children in their care.

  abstract = {The Movement for Global Mental Health's (MGMH) efforts to scale up the availability of mental health services have been moderately successful. Investigations in resource-poor countries like South Africa have pointed to the value of an integrated primary mental health care model and multidisciplinary collaboration to support mental health needs in underserved and underresourced communities. However, there remains a need to explore how these policies play out within the daily realities of communities marked by varied environmental and relational complexities. Arguably, the lived realities of mental health policy and service delivery processes are best viewed through ethnographic approaches, which remain underutilised in the field of global mental health. This paper reports on findings from a case study of mental health services for HIV-affected women in a rural South African setting, which employed a motivated ethnography in order to explore the realities of the primary mental health care model and related policies in South Africa. Findings highlighted the influence of three key symbolic (intangible) factors that impact on the efficacy of the primary mental health care model: power dynamics, which shaped relationships within multidisciplinary teams; stigma, which limited the efficacy of task-shifting strategies; and the silencing of women's narratives of distress within services. The resultant gap between policy ideals and the reality of practice is discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations for building on existing successes in the delivery of primary mental health care in South Africa.},

  abstract = {Importance: Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders globally but are rarely recognized or treated in low-income settings. Task-shifting of mental health care to lay health workers (LHWs) might decrease the treatment gap., Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted psychological intervention for common mental disorders delivered by LHWs in primary care., Design, Setting, and Participants: Cluster randomized clinical trial with 6 months' follow-up conducted from September 1, 2014, to May 25, 2015, in Harare, Zimbabwe. Twenty-four clinics were randomized 1:1 to the intervention or enhanced usual care (control). Participants were clinic attenders 18 years or older who screened positive for common mental disorders on the locally validated Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14)., Interventions: The Friendship Bench intervention comprised 6 sessions of individual problem-solving therapy delivered by trained, supervised LHWs plus an optional 6-session peer support program. The control group received standard care plus information, education, and support on common mental disorders., Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was common mental disorder measured at 6 months as a continuous variable via the SSQ-14 score, with a range of 0 (best) to 14 and a cutpoint of 9. The secondary outcome was depression symptoms measured as a binary variable via the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with a range of 0 (best) to 27 and a cutpoint of 11. Outcomes were analyzed by modified intention-to-treat., Results: Among 573 randomized patients (286 in the intervention group and 287 in the control group), 495 (86.4%) were women, median age was 33 years (interquartile range, 27-41 years), 238 (41.7%) were human immunodeficiency virus positive, and 521 (90.9%) completed follow-up at 6 months. Intervention group participants had fewer symptoms than control group participants on the SSQ-14 (3.81; 95% CI, 3.28 to 4.34 vs 8.90; 95% CI, 8.33 to 9.47; adjusted mean difference, -4.86; 95% CI, -5.63 to -4.10; P < .001; adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.29; P < .001). Intervention group participants also had lower risk of symptoms of depression (13.7% vs 49.9%; ARR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.34; P < .001)., Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals screening positive for common mental disorders in Zimbabwe, LHW-administered, primary care-based problem-solving therapy with education and support compared with standard care plus education and support resulted in improved symptoms at 6 months. Scaled-up primary care integration of this intervention should be evaluated., Trial Registration: pactr.org Identifier: PACTR201410000876178.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in developing country settings. The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate that Prolonged Exposure Treatment for Adolescents (PE-A) and supportive counselling (SC) are implementable by nurses in a South African context. A secondary aim was to perform a preliminary analysis of the effectiveness of registered nurses delivering either PE-A or SC treatment to adolescents with PTSD. It is hypothesised that PE-A will be superior to SC in terms of improvements in PTSD symptoms and depression., METHOD: A pilot, single-blind, randomised clinical trial of 11 adolescents with PTSD. Nurses previously naive to Prolonged Exposure (PE) Treatment and SC provided these treatments at the adolescents' high schools. Data collection lasted from March 2013 to October 2014. Participants received twelve 60-90-min sessions of PE (n = 6) or SC (n = 5). All outcomes were assessed before treatment, at mid-treatment, immediately after treatment completion and at 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed with the Child PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview (CPSS-I) (range, 0-51; higher scores indicate greater severity). The secondary outcome, depression severity, was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (range, 0-41; higher scores indicate greater severity)., RESULTS: Data were analysed as intention to treat. During treatment, participants in both the PE-A and SC treatment arms experienced significant improvement on the CPSS-I as well as on the BDI. There was a significant difference between the PE-A and SC groups in maintaining PTSD and depression at the 12-month post-treatment assessment, with the participants in the PE-A group maintaining their gains both on PTSD and depression measures., CONCLUSION: The treatment was adequately implemented by the nurses and well-tolerated by the participants. Preliminary results suggest that the delivery of either intervention led to a significant improvement in PTSD and depression symptoms immediately post treatment. The important difference was that improvement gains in PTSD and depression in the PE-A group were maintained at 12-month follow-up. The results of this pilot and feasibility study are discussed., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry: PACTR201511001345372 , registered on 11 November 2015.},

In this paper, we sought to provide an overview of the extent of unmet need and mental health services in Iran. We also aimed to propose approaches to address this gap., METHOD: We reviewed the published epidemiologic studies of child and adolescent mental and behavioral health problems in Iran. We also examined the current status of child mental health services and the gaps between current needs and available services based on published literature that included papers published in scientific journals, as well as governmental and other administrative reports. The contextual issues relevant to child mental health care were also explored, as well as the possibilities to introduce new or scale up promising services., RESULTS: Child and adolescent mental and behavioral health problems are highly prevalent in Iran. Different studies have estimated that 16.7% to 36.4% of children and adolescents suffer from one or more mental health problems. However, there is a serious scarcity of resources to meet this need. Available services are delivered by independent public organizations (e.g., Ministry of Health, Welfare Organization, and Ministry of Education) or private sector with inefficient communication and collaboration among them and no mandatory national mental health policy. Available specialized child and adolescent services are mostly confined to small inpatient units and university outpatient facilities in larger cities, and there is a scarce evidence for the effectiveness of the available services., CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of primary care's role in timely detection and management of child and adolescent mental health problems, implementation of task-shifting and -sharing initiatives, as well as improved collaboration among responsible governmental and non-governmental sectors are some of the most promising future venues to improve mental health care for the Iranian youth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The scarcity of mental health professionals places specialist psychiatric care out of the reach of most people in low and middle income countries. There is growing interest in the effectiveness of task shifting as a strategy for targeting expanding health care demands in settings with shortages of qualified health personnel. Given this background, the aim of our study was to examine the perceptions of psychiatrists and health policy directors about the policy to expand mental health care delivery in Ghana through a system of task-shifting from psychiatrists to community mental health workers (CMHWs)., METHODS: A self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was developed and administered to 11 psychiatrists and 29 health policy directors. Key informant interviews were also held with five psychiatrists and four health policy directors. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically., RESULTS: Almost all the psychiatrists and 23 (79.3 %) health policy directors were aware of the policy of the Government of Ghana to improve on the human resource base within mental health through a system of task-shifting. Overall, about half of the psychiatrists and 9 (31 %) health policy directors perceived there is some professional resistance to the implementation of the policy of task shifting. The majority of respondents were of the view that CMHWs should be allowed to assess, diagnose and treat most of the common mental disorders. The respondents identified that CMHWs usually perform two sets of roles, namely; officially assigned roles for which they have the requisite training and assumed roles for which they usually do not have the requisite training. The stakeholders identified multiple challenges associated with current task shifting arrangements within Ghana's mental health delivery system, including inadequate training and supervision, poor awareness of the scope of their expertise on the part of the CMHWs., CONCLUSION: Psychiatrists and health policy directors support the policy to expand mental health service coverage in Ghana through a system of task-shifting, despite their awareness of resistance from some professionals. It is important that the Government of Ghana upholds its commitment of expanding mental healthcare by maintaining and prioritizing its policy on task shifting and also providing the necessary resources to ensure its success.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, access to mental healthcare is often lacking in rural, low-resource settings. Mental healthcare services integration in primary care settings is a key intervention to address this gap. A common strategy includes embedding mental healthcare workers on-site, and receiving consultation from an off-site psychiatrist. Primary care provider perspectives are important for successful program implementation., METHODS: We conducted three focus groups with all 24 primary care providers at a district-level hospital in rural Nepal. We asked participants about their concerns and recommendations for an integrated mental healthcare delivery program. They were also asked about current practices in seeking referral for patients with mental illness. We collected data using structured notes and analyzed the data by template coding to develop themes around concerns and recommendations for an integrated program., RESULTS: Participants noted that the current referral system included sending patients to the nearest psychiatrist who is 14 h away. Participants did not think this was effective, and stated that integrating mental health into the existing primary care setting would be ideal. Their major concerns about a proposed program included workplace hierarchies between mental healthcare workers and other clinicians, impact of staff turnover on patients, reliability of an off-site consultant psychiatrist, and ability of on-site primary care providers to screen patients and follow recommendations from an off-site psychiatrist. Their suggestions included training a few existing primary care providers as dedicated mental healthcare workers, recruiting both senior and junior mental healthcare workers to ensure retention, recruiting academic psychiatrists for reliability, and training all primary care providers to appropriately screen for mental illness and follow recommendations from the psychiatrist., CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers in rural Nepal reported the failure of the current system of referral, which includes sending patients to a distant city. They welcomed integrating mental healthcare into the primary care system, and reported several concerns and recommendations to increase the likelihood of successful implementation of such a program.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The negative effects of perinatal depression on the mother and child start early and persist throughout the lifecourse (Lancet 369(9556):145-57, 2007; Am J Psychiatry 159(1):43-7, 2002; Arch Dis Child 77(2):99-101, 1997; J Pak Med Assoc 60(4):329; J Psychosoma Res 49(3):207-16, 2000; Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev 14(1):1-27, 2011). Given that 10-35 % of children worldwide are exposed to perinatal depression in their first year of life (Int Rev Psychiatry 8(1):37-54, 1996), mitigating this intergenerational risk is a global public health priority (Perspect Public Health 129(5):221-7, 2009; Trop Med Int Health 13(4):579-83, 2008; Br Med Bull 101(1):57-79, 2012). However, it is not clear whether intervention with depressed women can have long-term benefits for the mother and/or her child. We describe a study of the effectiveness of a peer-delivered depression intervention delivered through 36 postnatal months, the Thinking Healthy Program Peer-delivered PLUS (THPP+) for women and their children in rural Pakistan., METHODS/DESIGN: The THPP+ study aims are: (1) to evaluate the effects of an extended 36-month perinatal depression intervention on maternal and index child outcomes using a cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT) and (2) to determine whether outcomes among index children of perinatally depressed women in the intervention arm converge with those of index children born to perinatally nondepressed women. The trial is designed to recruit 560 pregnant women who screened positive for perinatal depression (PHQ-9 score >=10) from 40 village clusters, of which 20 receive the THPP+ intervention. An additional reference group consists of 560 perinatally nondepressed women from the same 40 clusters as the THPP+ trial. The women in the nondepressed group are not targeted to receive the THPP+ intervention; but, by recruiting pregnant women from both intervention and control clusters, we are able to evaluate any carryover effects of the THPP+ intervention on the women and their children. Perinatally depressed women in the THPP+ intervention arm receive bimonthly group-based sessions. Primary outcomes are 3-year maternal depression and 3-year child development indicators. Analyses are intention-to-treat and account for the clustered design., DISCUSSION: This trial, together with the reference group, has the potential to further our understanding of the early developmental lifecourse of children of both perinatally depressed and perinatally nondepressed women in rural Pakistan and to determine whether intervening with women's depression in the perinatal period can mitigate the negative effects of maternal depression on 36-month child development., TRIAL REGISTRATION: THPP-P ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02111915 (registered on 9 April 2014).

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: South Africa is a middle-income country with serious socioeconomic risk factors for mental illness. Of its population of 52 million, 53% live below the poverty line, 24% are unemployed and 11% live with HIV/AIDS, all of which are factors associated with an increased burden of neuropsychiatric disease. The negative social implications due to the mortality caused by AIDS are immense: thousands of children are being orphaned, increasing the risk of intergenerational mental illness. Ensuring sufficient mental health human resources has been a challenge, with South Africa displaying lower workforce numbers than many low- and middle-income countries. It is in South Africa's public rural primary healthcare (PRPHC) areas where access to mental healthcare services, especially medical prescribers, is most dire. In 1994, primary healthcare (PHC) was mainstreamed into South Africa's public healthcare system as an inclusive, people-orientated healthcare system. Nurses provide for the majority of the human resources at PHC level and are therefore seen as the backbone of this sector. Efforts to decentralize mental healthcare and integrate it into the PHC system rely on the availability of mental health nurses (MHNs), to whom the task of diagnosing mental illness and prescribing psychotropic medications can be shifted. The goal of this situation analysis was to fill knowledge gaps with regard to MHN human resources in South Africa's PRPHC settings, where an estimated 40% of South Africa's population reside., METHODS: Both primary and secondary data were analysed. Primary data was collected by inviting 160 (98%) of South African rural hospitals' clinical heads to participate in an interview schedule regarding mental health human resources at their institutions. Primary data were collated and then analysed using descriptive quantitative analysis to produce lists of MHNs per institution and per province. Secondary data was obtained from an extensive literature review of MHNs in South Africa, but also of mental healthcare services in other low- and middle-income countries. The literature review included reports by the National Department of Health and the South African Nursing Council, academic publications and dissertations as well as census data from Statistics South Africa, including findings from the 2011 general household survey. International secondary data was obtained from the WHO's most recent reports on global mental health., RESULTS: The findings suggest a distressing shortage of MHNs in South Africa's rural public areas. Only 62 (38.7%) of the 160 facilities employ MHNs, a total of 116 MHNs. These MHNs serve an estimated population of more than 17 million people, suggesting that MHNs are employed at a rate of 0.68 per 100 000 population in South Africa's PRPHC areas., CONCLUSIONS: Secondary data analysis indicates that MHNs are practicing in South Africa at a national rate of 9.7 per 100 000 population. This unequal distribution calls for a redistribution of MHNs to PRPHC areas. Further recommendations are made to address the mental healthcare workforce crisis by upscaling human resources in PRPHC areas. Revisiting policy surrounding training programs and the current evidence-based approach of task shifting is advised. Innovative approaches such as extending mental healthcare professions' roles and scopes of practice at PHC level are necessary to ensure adequate mental health care for all South Africans.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Given the high prevalence and detrimental consequences of alcohol or other drug (AOD) use in low- and middle-income countries, a screening tool for early detection in health care, including emergency care, is critical. We set out to validate the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) for the South African context., DESIGN AND METHODS: We interviewed emergency centre patients (n = 200) in Cape Town for this cross-sectional study conducted from January to March 2013 utilising a questionnaire battery, including the ASSIST and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and screening properties of the ASSIST (receiver operating characteristic analysis) were examined utilising the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview AOD use modules as the gold standard., RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for alcohol and illicit drugs ranged from 0.81 to 0.95 indicating good internal consistency. ASSIST cut-off scores show a good sensitivity and specificity for discrimination particularly when distinguishing between substance use and abuse, rather than dependence. For alcohol, the area under the curve was 0.94 for distinguishing between use and abuse, and this dropped to 0.68 for distinguishing between abuse and dependence, while the statistic remained high for both use/abuse and abuse/dependence for illicit drugs: 0.95 and 0.96., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: AOD abuse was associated with cut-off scores below the World Health Organization recommended levels, in keeping with various international studies suggesting that individuals with lower scores be offered interventions. The ASSIST was found to be useful for South African health care and holds promise for cost-effective task-shifting approaches in lower resourced settings.

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: Depression is common among people living with HIV, and it has consequences for both HIV prevention and treatment response, yet depression treatment is rarely integrated into HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa, partly due to the paucity of mental health professionals. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of two task-shifting models to facilitating depression care delivered by medical providers: one that utilized a structured protocol, and one that relied on clinical acumen, in 10 HIV clinics in Uganda. Both models started with routine depression screening of all clients at triage using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), from which we enrolled 1252 clients (640 at structured protocol clinics, 612 at clinical acumen clinics) who had screened positive over 12 months. We compared the two models on (1) proportion of all client participants, and those clinically depressed (based on survey-administered 9-item PHQ-9>9), who received post-screening evaluation for depression using the PHQ-9; and (2) proportion of clinically depressed who were prescribed antidepressant therapy. Linear probability regression analyses were conducted using a wild cluster bootstrap to control for clustering; patient characteristics, clinic size and time fixed effects were included as covariates. Among all client participants, those in the structured protocol arm were far more likely to have received further evaluation by a medical provider using the PHQ-9 (84% vs. 49%; beta = .33; p = .01). Among the clinically depressed clients (n = 369), the advantage of the structured protocol model over clinical acumen was not statistically significant with regard to PHQ-9 depression evaluation (93% vs. 68%; beta = .21; p = .14) or prescription of antidepressants (69% vs. 58%; beta = .10; p = .50), in part because only 30% of clients who screened positive were clinically depressed. These findings reveal that in both models depression care practices were widely adopted by providers, and depression care reached most depressed clients. The structured protocol model is advantageous for ensuring that positively screened clients receive a depression evaluation, but the two models performed equally well in ensuring the treatment of depressed clients in the context of strong supervision support., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02056106.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The study discusses key issues and concepts of how to provide basic mental health services for people with mental disorders in low and middle-income countries (LAMICs)., RECENT FINDINGS: In the last years a considerable gap between mental healthcare needs and available services in LAMICs has been documented. The transformation of hospital-based to community-based mental health and the building of accessible services in low-resource settings require mental health training of primary care providers, task-sharing/task-shifting models, involvement of families and peers and basic models of community rehabilitation. Several international initiatives have been set up to increase the evidence base and test the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of these approaches which are not new but which have been implemented in only a small amount of LAMICs. A combination of interventions on different levels (governance, legislation, providers, and community) is necessary., SUMMARY: It remains to be shown how the recent global mental health movement, beyond increasing international financial resources, will be helpful in finding locally and culturally sensitive solutions to reduce the mental health gap in LAMICs. Although concepts of a well designed mix of services are available, solutions to reduce implementation barriers must be local, and implementation strategies may vary considerably and still lack a sufficient evidence base.},

Data extraction and thematic analysis were used to synthesize findings. Quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool and certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research approach., RESULTS: Twenty-five studies from 11 countries focused on adults (24 studies), adolescents (eight studies), and pregnant women (four studies). Facilitators included community-level factors (i.e., task shifting, mobile outreach, integrated HIV, and primary services, supportive cessation programs for substance users, active referrals, and dedicated case management teams), and individual-level factors (encouragement of peers/family and positive interactions with healthcare providers in transitioning into care). One key barrier for people living with HIV was perceived inability of providers to ensure confidentiality as part of linkage to care interventions. Providers reported difficulties navigating procedures across disparate facilities and having limited resources for linkage to care interventions., CONCLUSION: Our findings extend the literature by highlighting the importance of task-shifting, mobile outreach, integrated HIV, and primary care services. Both community and individual-level factors may increase the feasibility and acceptability of HIV linkage to care interventions. These findings may inform policies to increase the reach of HIV services available in communities.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in the effectiveness of task shifting as a strategy for addressing expanding health care challenges in settings with shortages of qualified health personnel. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of stakeholders about the adequacy of training, supervision and support offered to community mental health workers (CMHWs) in Ghana. To address this aim we designed and administered self-completed, semi-structured questionnaires adapted to three specific stakeholder groups in Ghana. The questionnaires were administered to 11 psychiatrists, 29 health policy implementers/coordinators and 164 CMHWs, across Ghana, including 71 (43.3%) Community Psychiatric Nurses (CPNs), 19 (11.6%) Clinical Psychiatric Officers (CPOs) and 74 (45.1%) Community Mental Health Officers (CMHOs). Almost all the stakeholders believed CMHWs in Ghana receive adequate training for the role they are expected to play although many identify some gaps in the training of these mental health workers for the expanded roles they actually play. There were statistically significant differences between the different CMHW groups and the types of in-service training they said they had attended, the frequency with which their work was supervised, and the frequency with which they received feedback from supervisors. CPOs were more likely to attend all the different kinds of in-service training than CMHOs and CPNs, while CMHOs were more likely than CPOs and CPNs to report that their work is never supervised or that they rarely or never receive feedback from supervisors. There was disparity between what CMHWs said were their experiences and the perception of policy makers with respect to the types of in-service training that is available to CMHWs. There is a need to review the task shifting arrangements, perhaps with a view to expanding it to include more responsibilities, and therefore review the curriculum of the training institution for CMHWs and also to offer them regular in-service training and formal supervision.

  abstract = {Introduction: The prevalence of common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, is high and the demand for psychological interventions and talking therapies is increasing. In order to meet this need, it is necessary to explore alternative methods to deliver talking therapies. Training lay health workers (LHWs) to deliver psychological interventions might be one possible solution to address current gaps in service provision. A number of studies have successfully used this approach to deliver psychological interventions in order to meet the demand for mental health care. Despite increased interest in this area, the evidence has not been synthesised or systematically reviewed., Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL) were systematically searched to specifically capture studies on task-shifting psychological interventions for common mental disorders. Data were extracted on the experiences of the lay-workers on training and therapy delivery. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Themes and subthemes of LHWs views on receiving training, barriers and facilitators to therapy delivery, factors required to become a successful therapist and the impact of training and therapy delivery on the therapists are described., Results: 10 studies were eligible for inclusion. Key messages were: LHWs were satisfied with training but wanted more robust supervision; not enough time was given to training on understanding mental health problems; LHWs grew in confidence and this impacted on their personal relationships with others., Conclusion: This is the first review to explore LHWs experiences in training and therapy delivery by synthesising existing qualitative research. A number of key messages derived out of this review can help in further improving the quality of the training programmes and highlighting the benefits that are available for the LHW in delivering psychological interventions.

  abstract = {Background: Major efforts are underway to improve access to mental health care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) including systematic training of non-specialized health professionals and other care providers to identify and help individuals with mental disorders. In many LMIC, this effort is guided by the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) established by the World Health Organization, and commonly centres around one tool in this program: the mhGAP-Intervention Guide., Objective: To identify cultural and contextual challenges in mhGAP training and implementation and potential strategies for mitigation., Method: An informal consultative approach was used to analyze the authors' combined field experience in the practice of mhGAP implementation and training. We employed iterative thematic analysis to consolidate and refine lessons, challenges and recommendations through multiple drafts. Findings were organized into categories according to specific challenges, lessons learned and recommendations for future practice. We aimed to identify cross-cutting and recurrent issues., Results: Based on intensive fieldwork experience with a focus on capacity building, we identify six major sets of challenges: (i) cultural differences in explanations of and attitudes toward mental disorder; (ii) the structure of the local health-care system; (iii) the level of supervision and support available post-training; (iv) the level of previous education, knowledge and skills of trainees; (v) the process of recruitment of trainees; and (vi) the larger socio-political context. Approaches to addressing these problems include: (1) cultural and contextual adaptation of training activities, (2) meaningful stakeholder and community engagement, and (3) processes that provide support to trainees, such as ongoing supervision and Communities of Practice., Conclusion: Contextual and cultural factors present major barriers to mhGAP implementation and sustainability of improved services. To enable trainees to effectively apply their local cultural knowledge, mhGAP training needs to: (1) address assumptions, biases and stigma associated with mental health symptoms and problems; (2) provide an explicit framework to guide the integration of cultural knowledge into assessment, treatment negotiation, and delivery; and (3) address the specific kinds of problems, modes of clinical presentations and social predicaments seen in the local population. Continued research is needed to assess the effectiveness these strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: An essential strategy to increase coverage of psychosocial treatments globally is task shifting to non-medical counsellors, but evidence on its effectiveness is still scarce. This study evaluates the effectiveness of lay psychosocial counselling among persons with psychological distress in a primary health care setting in rural Nepal., Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial in Dang, rural Nepal (NCT03544450). Persons aged 16 and older attending primary care and with a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score of 6 or more were randomized (1:1) to receive either non-medical psychosocial counselling (PSY) or enhanced usual care (EUC). PSY was provided by lay persons with a 6-month training and consisted of 5-weekly counselling sessions of 35-60 min with a culturally adapted solution-focused approach. EUC was provided by trained primary health workers. Participants were followed up at 1 (T1) and 6 months (T2). The primary outcome, response to treatment, was the reduction of minimum 50% in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score., Results: A total of 141 participants, predominantly socially disadvantaged women, were randomized to receive PSY and 146 to EUC. In the PSY, 123 participants and 134 in the EUC were analysed. In PSY, 101 participants (81.4%) had a response compared with 57 participants (42.5%) in EUC [percentage difference 39.4% (95% CI 28.4-50.4)]. The difference in BDI scores at T2 between PSY and EUC was -7.43 (95% CI -9.71 to -5.14)., Conclusions: Non-medical (lay) psychosocial counselling appears effective in reducing depressive symptoms, and its inclusion in mental health care should be considered in low-resource settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps could constitute a cost-effective strategy to overcome health care system access barriers to mental health services for people in low- and middle-income countries., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to explore the patients' perspectives of CONEMO (Emotional Control, in Spanish: Control Emocional), a technology-driven, psychoeducational, and nurse-supported intervention delivered via a smartphone app aimed at reducing depressive symptoms in people with diabetes, hypertension or both who attend public health care centers, as well as the nurses' feedback about their role and its feasibility to be scaled up., METHODS: This study combines data from 2 pilot studies performed in Lima, Peru, between 2015 and 2016, to test the feasibility of CONEMO. Interviews were conducted with 29 patients with diabetes, hypertension or both with comorbid depressive symptoms who used CONEMO and 6 staff nurses who accompanied the intervention. Using a content analysis approach, interview notes from patient interviews were transferred to a digital format, coded, and categorized into 6 main domains: the perceived health benefit, usability, adherence, user satisfaction with the app, nurse's support, and suggestions to improve the intervention. Interviews with nurses were analyzed by the same approach and categorized into 4 domains: general feedback, evaluation of training, evaluation of study activities, and feasibility of implementing this intervention within the existing structures of health system., RESULTS: Patients perceived improvement in their emotional health because of CONEMO, whereas some also reported better physical health. Many encountered some difficulties with using CONEMO, but resolved them with time and practice. However, the interactive elements of the app, such as short message service, android notifications, and pop-up messages were mostly perceived as challenging. Satisfaction with CONEMO was high, as was the self-reported adherence. Overall, patients evaluated the nurse accompaniment positively, but they suggested improvements in the technological training and an increase in the amount of contact. Nurses reported some difficulties in completing their tasks and explained that the CONEMO intervention activities competed with their everyday work routine., CONCLUSIONS: Using a nurse-supported smartphone app to reduce depressive symptoms among people with chronic diseases is possible and mostly perceived beneficial by the patients, but it requires context-specific adaptations regarding the implementation of a task shifting approach within the public health care system. These results provide valuable information about user feedback for those building mobile health interventions for depression.

A cascaded model of training and supervision was developed to sustain delivery of an evidence-based peer-delivered intervention for perinatal depression (the Thinking Healthy Programme) in rural Pakistan. The study aimed to evaluate the model., Methods: Mixed methods were employed as part of a randomised controlled trial of the intervention. Quantitative data consisted of the peers' competencies assessed during field training and over the implementation phase of the intervention, using a specially developed checklist. Qualitative data were collected from peers and their trainers through 11 focus groups during the second and third year of intervention rollout., Results: Following training, 43 peers out of 45 (95%) achieved at least a 'satisfactory' level of competency (scores of 70% on the Quality and Competency Checklist). Of the cohort of 45 peers initially recruited 34 (75%) were retained over 3 years and showed sustained or improved competencies over time. Qualitatively, the key factors contributing to peers' competency were use of interactive training and supervision techniques, the trainer-peer relationship, and their cultural similarity. The partnership with community health workers and use of primary health care facilities for training and supervision gave credibility to the peers in the community., Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lay-workers such as peers can be trained and supervised to deliver a psychological intervention using a cascaded model, thus addressing the barrier of scarcity of specialist trainers and supervisors.},

The Connections to Care (C2C) program, a $30 million public-private partnership under the federal Social Innovation Fund, with oversight from the C2C Collaborative, aims to address this problem by reaching up to 40,000 New Yorkers over five years by encouraging formal collaborations between community-based organizations (CBOs) and mental health providers (MHPs). In the C2C task-shifting model, mental health specialists equip non-specialist direct service staff at CBOs with the skills to deliver nonmedical mental health services while also facilitating referrals for more intensive care, if needed. By the end of the first year of C2C implementation, CBOs had contracted with MHPs, and together they developed operational plans, and delivered C2C services to over 4,000 CBO clients. The RAND Corporation is evaluating the results of the C2C program from three vantage points: the effect of C2C on participating clients, relative to a comparison group of New Yorkers not receiving C2C services (impact); the program's implementation across different CBOs; and the effects of the program on government and CBO spending. The purpose of this brief research study is to present preliminary key findings from interviews with CBO leadership, conducted between June and August of 2017, which focused on CBO leaders' experiences launching C2C at their organizations. We share these findings to support CBOs and additional stakeholders in decisionmaking for C2C during the implementation phase.

One barrier is the lack of MH assessment tools lay staff can validly and reliably administer in settings with few MH professionals., Methods: In a South African (SA) peri-urban cohort, we examined psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a widely used measure of child emotional and behavioral functioning. Data come from a large population-based study (N=1581) of children 4-6 years old. Lay fieldworkers administered the SDQ in isiZulu to caregivers at baseline and two years later. Exploratory factor analysisexamined whether the established SDQ five-factor structure and Total Difficulties score would be replicated. The psychometric model was tailored for ordinal items, and target factor rotation was used., Results: Total Difficulties, Emotional symptoms and Prosocial behavior factors were supported, with partial support for Conduct problems. Peer relationships and Hyperactivity/inattentive subscale items loaded poorly. Subscale Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.29 (Peers) to 0.62 (Emotional). Internal consistency of Total Difficulties score was acceptable (0.74); 30% scored in the abnormal range on Total Difficulties, based on UK norms., Conclusions: SDQ scores in our sample suggest young children in SA are at high risk for MH problems. The SDQ, particularly the Total Difficulties score, may be a useful screening tool in SA. Yet, some subscales did not work in this language and context; if social skills and hyperactivity/inattention arebeing considered, modification or additional measures may be needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-specialist healthcare providers, including primary and community healthcare workers, in low- and middle-income countries can effectively treat mental illness. However, scaling-up mental health services within existing health systems has been limited by barriers such as stigma against people with mental illness. Therefore, interventions are needed to address attitudes and behaviors among non-specialists. Aimed at addressing this gap, REducing Stigma among HealthcAre Providers to ImprovE mental health services (RESHAPE) is an intervention in which social contact with mental health service users is added to training for non-specialist healthcare workers integrating mental health services into primary healthcare., Methods: This protocol describes a mixed methods pilot and feasibility study in primary care centers in Chitwan, Nepal. The qualitative component will include key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The quantitative component consists of a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT), which will establish parameters for a future effectiveness study of RESHAPE compared to training as usual (TAU). Primary healthcare facilities (the cluster unit, k = 34) will be randomized to TAU or RESHAPE. The direct beneficiaries of the intervention are the primary healthcare workers in the facilities (n = 150); indirect beneficiaries are their patients (n = 100). The TAU condition is existing mental health training and supervision for primary healthcare workers delivered through the Programme for Improving Mental healthcarE (PRIME) implementing the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The primary objective is to evaluate acceptability and feasibility through qualitative interviews with primary healthcare workers, trainers, and mental health service users. The secondary objective is to collect quantitative information on health worker outcomes including mental health stigma (Social Distance Scale), clinical knowledge (mhGAP), clinical competency (ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors, ENACT), and implicit attitudes (Implicit Association Test, IAT), and patient outcomes including stigma-related barriers to care, daily functioning, and symptoms., Discussion: The pilot and feasibility study will contribute to refining recommendations for implementation of mhGAP and other mental health services in primary healthcare settings in low-resource health systems. The pilot c-RCT findings will inform an effectiveness trial of RESHAPE to advance the evidence-base for optimal approaches to training and supervision for non-specialist providers., Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02793271.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper seeks to review the available evidence to determine whether a systems approach is employed in the implementation and evaluation of task shifting for mental health using lay providers in low- and middle-income countries, and to highlight system-wide effects of task-shifting strategies in order to better inform efforts to strength community mental health systems., Methods: Pubmed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers with a third reviewer resolving discrepancies. Two stages of screens were done to ensure sensitivity. Studies were analysed using the World Health Organization's building blocks framework with the addition of a community building block, and systems thinking characteristics to determine the extent to which system-wide effects had been considered., Results: Thirty studies were included. Almost all studies displayed positive findings on mental health using task shifting. One study showed no effect. No studies explicitly employed systems thinking tools, but some demonstrated systems thinking characteristics, such as exploring various stakeholder perspectives, capturing unintended consequences, and looking across sectors for system-wide impact. Twenty-five of the 30 studies captured elements other than the most directly relevant building blocks of service delivery and health workforce., Conclusions: There is a lack of systematic approaches to exploring complexity in the evaluation of task-shifting interventions. Systems thinking tools should support evidence-informed decision making for a more complete understanding of community-based systems strengthening interventions for mental health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the effectiveness of task shifting of mental health services in populations with HIV., OBJECTIVE: This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of group support psychotherapy delivered by trained lay health workers to persons living with HIV (PLWH) with depression in primary care., METHODS: Thirty eligible primary care health centers across three districts were randomly allocated to have their lay health workers trained to deliver group support psychotherapy (intervention arm) or group HIV education and treatment as usual (control arm) to PLWH with depression. Treated PLWH will be evaluated at baseline, after the end of treatment, and at 6-month intervals thereafter for 2 years. Primary outcomes will be the difference in follow-up proportions of participants with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria for major depression and difference in follow-up function scores of participants in the intervention and control arms 6 months after the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes will include measures of self-esteem, posttraumatic stress symptoms, social support, stigma, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, viral load, and number of disability days, asset possession indices, and cost-effectiveness data. Primary and secondary outcomes as well as subgroup analyses will be conducted at the individual level using multilevel random effects regression analyses adjusting for clustering in health centers. A process evaluation using mixed methods to assess acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, causal mediating processes, and contextual influences in the trial will be conducted., RESULTS: The trial has been approved by the Makerere College of Health Sciences School of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee, the AIDS Support Organization, and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology. A data and safety monitoring board has been put in place to monitor trial progress. A total of 1140 persons living with HIV have been recruited to the trial. An analysis of baseline and 6-month data is in progress. The results of this trial will not only be presented at national and international conferences but also submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and as a report to the funding agencies., CONCLUSIONS: This cluster randomized trial will provide critical evidence to support culturally sensitive group-based psychotherapy for depression treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. Process evaluation outcomes will provide contextual information that health care and public health stakeholders can use to guide implementation decisions for their particular setting., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR): 201608001738234; http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/ appmanager/atm/atmregistry?dar=true&tNo=PACTR201608001738234 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/ 6vUAgAQlj).

  abstract = {Background: Most evaluations of task-shifting have focused on common mental disorders. Much less work has been done on severe mental neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders, such as chronic psychosis and epilepsy. Given the high burden associated with severe MNS and the lack of mental health professionals in low and middle income countries, evaluations on the impact of task-shifting for these disorders are important., Methods: In a rural district of Nepal, a community mental health program, based on World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme guidelines, was evaluated using a cohort study design. People with epilepsy and psychotic disorders were interviewed at treatment initiation and at 12-month follow-up. We also compared a group that was offered a comprehensive package of care (medication combined with psychosocial interventions, such as counselling and peer support groups) to a group that received medication only., Results: One-hundred nineteen persons were enrolled in the epilepsy cohort (EC) and 85 in the psychosis cohort (PC). The patients were enrolled in either the comprehensive package (n = 157) or medication only (n = 47). There was significant improvement (P < 0.0001) in psychosis symptoms (PC: Z = 6.78, r = 0.80) and depressive symptoms (EC: Z = 7.43, r = 0.73; PC: Z = 6.02, r = 0.70), seizures (EC: Z = 6.78), functional disability (EC: Z = 6.38, r = 0.67; PC: Z = 4.60, r = 0.57), family and caregiver burden (EC: Z = 8.09, r = 0.85; PC: Z = 6.81, r = 0.84), and social behaviour (PC: Z = 5.94, r = 0.84). There was greater risk reduction for recent seizures among people with epilepsy in the comprehensive treatment package vs. medication only (risk ratio = 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.95; P = 0.03); no other significant differences were observed between treatment arms., Conclusions: A community mental health program in Nepal, implemented by non-specialists, resulted in moderate to large effects among people with epilepsy or psychosis. A comprehensive package of care, including counselling and patient support groups, appears to offer added clinical benefits for patients with epilepsy. For people with psychosis, the basic package of care (i.e., psychotropic medications) performed similar to the comprehensive package, suggesting a less resource-intensive package may offer comparable results.},

Focus Group Discussions (FGDs, n = 9) and Key-Informant Interviews (KIIs, n = 26) were conducted in a rural district in western Nepal. Qualitative data were coded using the Framework Analysis Method employing QSR NVIVO software., Results: Health workers, general community members, and persons living with mental illness typically attributed mental illness to witchcraft, curses, and punishment for sinful acts. Persons with mental illness are often physically bound or locked in structures near their homes. Mental health services in medical settings are not available. Traditional healers are often the first treatment of choice. Primary care workers are limited both by lack of knowledge about mental illness and the inability to prescribe psychotropic medication. Health workers supported upgrading their existing knowledge and skills through mhGAP resources. Health workers lacked familiarity with basic computing and mobile technology, but they supported the introduction of mobile technology for delivering effective mental health services. Persons with mental illness and their family members supported the development of patient support groups for collective organization and advocacy. Stakeholders also supported development of focal community resource persons to aid in mental health service delivery and education., Conclusion: Health workers, persons living with mental illness and their families, and other stakeholders identified current gaps and barriers related to mental health services. However, respondents were generally supportive in developing community-based care in rural Nepal.},

Refugees are at considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most refugees do not have access to mental health services for these problems because of multiple barriers in national and refugee specific health systems, including limited availability of mental health professionals. To counter some of challenges arising from limited mental health system capacity the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a range of scalable psychological interventions aimed at reducing psychological distress and improving functioning in people living in communities affected by adversity. These interventions, including Problem Management Plus (PM+) and its variants, are intended to be delivered through individual or group face-to-face or smartphone formats by lay, non-professional people who have not received specialized mental health training, We provide an evidence-based rationale for the use of the scalable PM+ oriented programmes being adapted for Syrian refugees and provide information on the newly launched STRENGTHS programme for adapting, testing and scaling up of PM+ in various modalities in both neighbouring and European countries hosting Syrian refugees.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substance use is a well-established, and potentially modifiable, risk factor for suicide. Suicide prevention interventions are typically framed within the biomedical paradigm and focus on addressing individual risk factors, improving access to psychiatric care, and improving the skills of medical personnel to recognise at-risk individuals. Few studies have focused on contextual factors that hinder suicide prevention in people with substance use disorders, particularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore mental health care providers' perceptions of barriers to suicide prevention in people with substance use disorders in South Africa., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 mental health care providers who worked with suicidal people with substance use disorders in Cape Town, South Africa. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and Atlas.ti software was used to code the data inductively., RESULTS: Two superordinate themes were identified: structural issues in service provision and broad contextual issues that pose barriers to suicide prevention. Participants thought that inadequate resources and insufficient training hindered them from preventing suicide. Fragmented service provision was perceived to lead to patients not receiving the psychiatric, psychological, and social care that they needed. Contextual problems such as poverty and inequality, the breakdown of family, and stigma made participants think that preventing suicide in people with substance use disorders was almost impossible., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that structural, social, and economic issues serve as barriers to suicide prevention. This challenges individual risk-factor models of suicide prevention and highlights the need to consider a broad range of contextual and socio-cultural factors when planning suicide prevention interventions. Findings suggest that the responsibility for suicide prevention may need to be distributed between multiple stakeholders, necessitating intersectoral collaboration, more integrated health services, cautious use of task shifting, and addressing contextual factors in order to effectively prevent suicide in people with substance use disorders.},

Furthermore, additional research capacity building and research grants leveraged on SHARE network were secured. The salient lessons learned in the 5-year program were that research capacity-building opportunities need to be tailored to the local context, as SHARE sought to develop and support courses that can build the capacities in specific areas identified as weak in the South Asian region. Mentoring was recognized as a critical component for which innovative and effective models of mentoring in the region need to be developed. Diverse platforms and mediums ought to be utilized to deliver the research training programs.

The aim of this study was to explore the facilitators and barriers to the acceptability of peer volunteers (PVs)-volunteer lay women from the community with shared socio-demographic and life experiences with the target population-as delivery agents of a psychosocial intervention for perinatal depression in a rural area of Pakistan., METHODS: This qualitative study was embedded in the pilot phase of a larger peer-delivered mental health programme. Forty nine participants were included: depressed mothers (n = 21), PVs (n = 8), primary health care staff (n = 5), husbands (n = 5) and mothers-in-law (n = 10). Data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus groups and analysed using the Framework Analysis approach., RESULTS: The PVs were accepted as delivery agents by all key stakeholders. Facilitators included the PVs' personal attributes such as being local, trustworthy, empathetic, and having similar experiences of motherhood. The perceived usefulness and cultural appropriateness of the intervention and linkages with the primary health care (PHC) system was vital to their legitimacy and credibility. The PVs' motivation was important, and factors influencing this were: appropriate selection; effective training and supervision; community endorsement of their role, and appropriate incentivisation. Barriers included women's lack of autonomy, certain cultural beliefs, stigma associated with depression, lack of some mothers' engagement and resistance from some families., CONCLUSION: PVs are a potential human resource for the delivery of a psychosocial intervention for perinatal depression in this rural area of Pakistan. The use of such delivery agents could be considered for other under-resourced settings globally.},

A comparative analysis was conducted to present the evolution of relevant data from 2010 to 2014., RESULTS: There are two psychiatric hospitals in the country and beds in general hospitals. In the period, the number of beds in general hospitals remained stable (203), and the beds in psychiatric hospitals increased from 173 to 298. Mental health outpatient facilities have increased from 83 to 152. The number of psychiatrists (9 in 2010, and 10 in 2014) remained very low, with a significant increase in the number of psychologists (56-109) and occupational therapists (2-23). The number of Psychiatric Technicians has increased from 66 in 2010, to 241 in 2014. This increase allowed the mental health network to expand from 60 to 135 Districts, meaning an increase of coverage from 44 to 100 % of the country districts., CONCLUSION: The task-shifting strategy focused on services delivered in primary care by psychiatric technicians, mid-level professionals, allowed the expansion of mental health services for all the country districts and the reduction of treatment gap in Mozambique.},

Rural areas are particularly disadvantaged due to lack of trained health workers. Ways to improve care could be by training village health workers in basic mental health care, and by using innovative methods of service delivery. The ongoing Systematic Medical Appraisal, Referral and Treatment Mental Health Programme will assess the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a task-shifting mobile-based intervention using mixed methods, in rural Andhra Pradesh, India., METHOD: The key components of the study are an anti-stigma campaign followed by a mobile-based mental health services intervention. The study will be done across two sites in rural areas, with intervention periods of 1 year and 3 months, respectively. The programme uses a mobile-based clinical decision support tool to be used by non-physician health workers and primary care physicians to screen, diagnose and manage individuals suffering from depression, suicidal risk and emotional stress. The key aim of the study will be to assess any changes in mental health services use among those screened positive following the intervention. A number of other outcomes will also be assessed using mixed methods, specifically focussed on reduction of stigma, increase in mental health awareness and other process indicators., CONCLUSIONS: This project addresses a number of objectives as outlined in the Mental Health Action Plan of World Health Organization and India's National Mental Health Programme and Policy. If successful, the next phase will involve design and conduct of a cluster randomised controlled trial.},

The authors implemented a multi-stage, transcultural adaptation for a pilot task sharing training in Haiti entailing three phases: 1) literature review and qualitative research to adapt a mental health and psychosocial support training; 2) implementation and qualitative process evaluation of a brief, structured group training; and 3) implementation and qualitative evaluation of an apprenticeship training, including a two year follow-up of trainees. Structured group training revealed limited knowledge acquisition, low motivation, time and resource constraints on mastery, and limited incorporation of skills into practice. Adding an apprenticeship component was associated with subjective clinical competency, increased confidence regarding utilising skills, and career advancement. Qualitative findings support the added value of apprenticeship according to trainees.},

Although the program was found to be acceptable, feasible, and effective in reducing depression outcomes, we did face challenges in implementation, which are outlined in this article. Key challenges included cultural factors (e.g., a lack of recognition of depression as a health-related entity amenable to professional treatment, relatively low levels of psychological mindedness useful for understanding of psychological interventions) and health system (e.g., lack of mental health specialists, overburdened health providers unfamiliar with behavioral interventions) factors. We discuss the strategies we employed to resolve these challenges and our successes and failures therein.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently Bolivia has implemented a universal health system, but their mental health policy is still emerging., OBJECTIVES: To investigate the current state of the mental health care system in Bolivia and discuss challenges for structuring a coordinated network of services that can effectively meet the needs of the Bolivian population., METHODS: This review was conducted by searching for scholarly articles through the databases Lilacs, Medline OPS, HISA and IBECS REPIDISCA via the search portal in the Virtual Health Library - NLM (http://www.bireme.br)., RESULTS: Bolivia has a National Mental Health Plan that is intended to guide mental health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of mental illness, but the resources for this area of health are limited. There are 1.06 psychiatrists and 0.46 psychologists per 100, 000 inhabitants. Information on psychiatric morbidity in Bolivia and the impact of mental disorders on the global burden of disease is scarce. Admission statistics reported by psychiatric hospitals in the country show that the main cause of hospitalization is substance abuse (30%). Alcohol consumption is responsible for 90% of these admissions, in addition to being a major cause of deaths in traffic and one of the main risk factors for domestic violence. Almost one in two women in Bolivia (47%) experienced some form of violence from their partner in the last year. Nineteen percent of women living with a partner reported being physically abused, while 7% were sexually abused by their partners. Isolated studies report that suicide rates are disproportionately high in Bolivia., CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a shortage of epidemiological data in Bolivia, it is clear the impact of alcohol addiction in psychiatric admissions, domestic violence and traffic accidents. Violence against women and suicides are important issues to be tackled. Among the proposed strategies to afford human resources for mental health in Bolivia, "task shifting", the delegation of tasks to non-specialists should be extensively adopted in the country to improve mental health care.},

  abstract = {Global mental health challenges sit at the frontiers of health care worldwide. The frequency of mental health disorders is increasing, and represents a large portion of the global burden of human disease (DALYs). There are many impeding forces in delivering mental health care globally. The knowledge of what mental health and its diseased states are limits the ability to seek appropriate care. Limited training and experience among primary providers dilutes the capacity of systems for adequate care, support, and intervention. There are limited numbers of medical personnel worldwide to attend to individuals afflicted by mental health disorders. The challenges of global mental health are the capacity of the global systems to enhance knowledge and literacy surrounding mental health disorders, enhance and expand ways of identifying and treating mental health disorders effectively at an early stage in its course. Much has been written about the epidemiology of mental health disorders globally followed by discussions of the need for improvements in programs that will improve the lot of the mentally ill. Task shifting involves the engaging of human resources, generally nonprofessional, in the care of mental health disorders. Engaging traditional healers and community health workers in the identification and management of mental health disorders is a very strong potential opportunity for task shifting care in mental health. In doing so it will be necessary to study the concept of mental health literacy of traditional healers and health workers in a process of mutual alignment of purpose founded on evidence based research.

The aim of this study was to understand how the use of a common implementation framework could assist in the integration of mental health into primary healthcare in Ugandan and South African district demonstration sites. The foci and form of the services developed differed across the country sites depending on the service gaps and resources available. South Africa focused on reducing the service gap for common mental disorders and Uganda, for severe mental disorders., METHOD: A qualitative post-intervention process evaluation using focus group and individual interviews with key stakeholders was undertaken in both sites. The emergent data was analyzed using framework analysis., RESULTS: Sensitization of district management authorities and the establishment of community collaborative multi-sectoral forums assisted in improving political will to strengthen mental health services in both countries. Task shifting using community health workers emerged as a promising strategy for improving access to services and help seeking behaviour in both countries. However, in Uganda, limited application of task shifting to identification and referral, as well as limited availability of psychotropic medication and specialist mental health personnel, resulted in a referral bottleneck. To varying degrees, community-based self-help groups showed potential for empowering service users and carers to become more self sufficient and less dependent on overstretched healthcare systems. They also showed potential for promoting social inclusion and addressing stigma, discrimination and human rights abuses of people with mental disorders in both country sites., CONCLUSIONS: A common implementation framework incorporating a community collaborative multi-sectoral, task shifting and self-help approach to integrating mental health into primary healthcare holds promise for closing the treatment gap for mental disorders in LMICs at district level. However, a minimum number of mental health specialists are still required to provide supervision of non-specialists as well as specialized referral treatment services.},

New global initiatives, such as the WHO's mental health Gap Action Program, are utilizing this evidence to devise packages of care for specific MNDs. This paper describes a plan that seeks to integrate the evidence on the treatment of specific MNDs, based on a task-shifting paradigm, for scaling up services for MNDs at the level of a defined population. The plan was developed by a state government in India in collaboration with technical partners, as a model District Mental Health Program for India's National Mental Health Program.},

Due to the scarcity of mental health professionals in many low and middle-income countries, counseling programs are increasingly utilizing paraprofessionals to provide support to the affected population as a strategy of task shifting. In this article, we would like to examine the effectiveness of counseling services provided by such trained paraprofessionals. This study was part of program evaluation to determine whether the participants (torture survivors) improved after counseling services provided by trained paraprofessionals in Indonesia. Local communities were invited to join the psychosocial program created and implemented by an NGO in 2005. The 178 participants were recruited from Jakarta, Papua, and Aceh, Indonesia for the program, which aimed to help survivors of violence suffering from "heavy hearts." The intervention lasted three months, and the follow-up intake was conducted after four months. The results indicated the participants' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, somatic symptoms, and functioning improved from the intake to the follow-up. The program appeared to have been effective in reducing the participants' symptoms and impairment in functioning. This indicates that in countries where there is a scarcity of mental health professionals, working with paraprofessionals has the potential to help survivors of torture and violence.},

A lower proportion of CMHOs worked closely with psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers compared with CPOs and CPNs. There was no significant difference in the proportion of the different CMHW types who expressed confidence in their ability to diagnose any of the commonly named mental health conditions except personality disorders. However, a lower proportion of CMHOs than CPOs and CPNs expressed confidence in their ability to treat all the disorders. The CMHWs ranked schizophrenia as the most frequently treated mental health condition and there was no statistically significant difference in the reported frequency with which the three groups of CMHWs treated any of the mental health conditions., CONCLUSIONS: Mental health policy makers and coordinators need to thoroughly review the training curriculum and also evaluate the job descriptions of all CMHWs in Ghana to ensure that they are consistent with the demands and health-care needs of patients they care for in their communities. For example, as CMHOs and CPNs prescribe medication even though they are not expected to do so, it may be worth exploring the merits of including the prescription of common psychotropic medication in their training curriculum and job descriptions.},

The majority of CMHWs were of the opinion that patients, psychiatrists and other healthcare workers have concerns about the quality of care they provide, sentiments that were echoed by all psychiatrists and over half of all the health policy directors., CONCLUSION: There is also a need for policy directors to educate CMHWs about their roles and to clarify referral pathways so that cases that are difficult to manage will be appropriately referred to psychiatrists or appropriately trained and incentivized district medical doctors for further management.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Catatonia is a potentially life-threatening but treatable neuropsychiatric condition. Although considered more common in low income countries, data is particularly sparse in these settings. In this study we explore the symptomatology, treatment, and short-term outcome of catatonia in Ethiopia, a low income country., METHODS: The study was a prospective evaluation of patients admitted with a DSM-IV diagnosis of catatonia. Diagnosis of Catatonia and its severity were further assessed with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS)., RESULTS: Twenty participants, 5 male and 15 female, were included in the study: 15 patients (75 %) had underlying mood disorders, 4 patients (20 %) had schizophrenia and 1 patient (5 %) had general medical condition. The most common catatonic symptoms, occurring in over two-thirds of participants, were mutism, negativism, staring and immobility (stupor). Eighteen (90 %) of the twenty patients were on multiple medications. Antipsychotics were the most commonly prescribed medications. ECT was required in seven patients (35.0 %). Dehydration, requiring IV rehydration, and infections were the most important complications ascribed to the catatonia. These occurred in seven patients (25 %). Almost all patients (n = 19/20) were discharged with significant improvement., CONCLUSION: This study supports the growing consensus that catatonia is most often associated with mood disorders. Overall prognosis appears very good although the occurrence of life-threatening complications underlines the serious nature of catatonia. This has implication for "task-shifted" service scale up plans, which aim to improve treatment coverage by training non-specialist health workers to provide mental health care in low income countries. Further larger scale studies are required to clarify the nature and management, as well as, service requirements for catatonia.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders constitute a major source of disability across the globe. In India, individuals with mental disorders are diagnosed and treated inadequately, particularly in under-served rural areas. We implemented and evaluated a psychiatric 'task shifting' program for a rural, marginalized, impoverished South Indian tribal community. The program was added to a pre-existing medical program and utilized community workers to improve health care delivery. Following community wide discussions, health workers were trained to provide community education and to identify and refer individuals with psychiatric problems to a community hospital. Subsequently, they also followed up the psychiatric patients to improve treatment adherence. The program was evaluated through medical records and community surveys. Treated patients experienced significant improvement in daily function (p=0.01). Mean treatment adherence scores remained stable at the beginning and end of treatment, overall. The proportion of self-referrals increased from 27% to 57% over three years. Surveys conducted before and after program initiation also suggested improved knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of mental illness by the community. The annual per capita cost of the program was 122.53 Indian Rupees per person per annum (USD 1.61). In conclusion, the community-driven psychiatric task shifting program was implemented successfully. It was accompanied by positive changes in knowledge, attitudes and practice. Initial community consultations and integration with a pre-existing medical program increased acceptance by the community and reduced costs. We recommend a similar model with integrated medical and psychiatric health care in other resource-deficient communities. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Mental Health Surveys conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that huge treatment gaps for severe mental disorders exist in both developed and developing countries. This gap is greatest in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Efforts to scale up mental health services in LMICs have to contend with the paucity of mental health professionals and health facilities providing specialist services for mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders. A pragmatic solution is to improve access to care through the facilities that exist closest to the community, via a task-shifting strategy. This study describes a pilot implementation program to integrate mental health services into primary health care in Nigeria., METHODS: The program was implemented over 18 months in 8 selected local government areas (LGAs) in Osun state of Nigeria, using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG), which had been contextualized for the local setting. A well supervised cascade training model was utilized, with Master Trainers providing training for the Facilitators, who in turn conducted several rounds of training for front-line primary health care workers. The first set of trainings by the Facilitators was supervised and mentored by the Master Trainers and refresher trainings were provided after 9 months., RESULTS: A total of 198 primary care workers, from 68 primary care clinics, drawn from 8 LGAs with a combined population of 966,714 were trained in the detection and management of four MNS conditions: moderate to severe major depression, psychosis, epilepsy, and alcohol use disorders, using the mhGAP-IG. Following training, there was a marked improvement in the knowledge and skills of the health workers and there was also a significant increase in the numbers of persons identified and treated for MNS disorders, and in the number of referrals. Even though substantial retention of gained knowledge was observed nine months after the initial training, some level of decay had occurred supporting the need for a refresher training., CONCLUSION: It is feasible to scale up mental health services in primary care settings in Nigeria, using the mhGAP-IG and a well-supervised cascade-training model. This format of training is pragmatic, cost-effective and holds promise, especially in settings where there are few specialists.},

Yet mental health services are limited in most HIV care programs in this region, in part due to severe shortages of mental health professionals. To address the need for establishing an effective, sustainable model for integrating depression treatment into HIV care in SSA, we have embarked upon a 3-year research project, INDEPTH Uganda (INtegrating DEPression Treatment and in HIV care in Uganda), to evaluate a task-sharing, protocolized approach to providing antidepressant care in ten HIV clinics in Uganda. In this paper we share our experiences with two treated cases identified during the initial days of implementation, which we believe highlight the potential value and policy implications for task shifting depression care models in under-resourced settings.

  abstract = {Since 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO), through its mental health Gap Action Programme, has attempted to revitalize efforts to integrate mental health into non-specialized (e.g. primary) healthcare. While this has led to renewed interest in this potential method of mental health service delivery, it has also prompted criticism. Some concerns raised are that it would contribute to the medicalization of social and psychological problems, and narrowly focus on primary care without sufficient attention given to strengthening other levels of the healthcare system, notably community-based care and care on district levels. This paper discusses seven elements that may be critical to preventing inadvertently contributing to increasing a narrow biomedical approach to mental healthcare when integrating mental health into non-specialized healthcare: (1) using task shifting approaches within a system of stepped care, (2) ensuring primary mental healthcare also includes brief psychotherapeutic interventions, (3) promote community-based recovery-oriented interventions for people with disabling chronic mental disorders, (4) conceptualizing training as a continuous process of strengthening clinical competencies through supervision, (5) engaging communities as partners in psychosocial interventions, (6) embedding shifts to primary mental healthcare within wider health policy reforms, and (7) promoting inter-sectoral approaches to address social determinants of mental health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are burdened by significant unmet mental health needs, but this region has limited access to mental health workers and resources to address these needs. Despite the successes of numerous school-based interventions for promoting child mental health, most evidence-based interventions are not available in SSA. This study will investigate the transportability of an evidence-based program from a developed country (United States) to a SSA country (Uganda). The approach includes task-shifting to early childhood teachers and consists of professional development (five days) to introduce strategies for effective behavior management and positive teacher-student interactions, and group-based consultation (14 sessions) to support adoption of effective practices and tailoring to meet the needs of individual students., METHODS/DESIGN: The design of this study is guided by two implementation frameworks, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Teacher Training Implementation Model, that consider multidimensional aspects of intervention fidelity and contextual predictors that may influence implementation and teacher outcomes. Using a cluster randomized design, 10 schools in Uganda will be randomized to either the intervention group (five schools) or the waitlist control group (five schools). A total of 80 to 100 early childhood teachers will be enrolled in the study. Teacher utilization of evidence-based strategies and practices will be assessed at baseline, immediate post-intervention (six months after baseline), and at seven months post-intervention (during a new academic year). Fidelity measures will be assessed throughout the program implementation period (during professional development and consultation sessions). Individual teacher and contextual factors will be assessed at baseline. Data will be collected from multiple sources. Linear mixed-effect modeling, adjusting for school nesting, will be applied to address study questions., DISCUSSION: The study will produce important information regarding the value of an evidence-based early intervention, and a theory-guided implementation process and tools designed for use in implementing early childhood evidence-based programs in SSA countries or resource-constrained community settings., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT097115) on 15 May 2013.},

  abstract = {Current efforts in global mental health (GMH) aim to address the inequities in mental health between low-income and high-income countries, as well as vulnerable populations within wealthy nations (e.g., indigenous peoples, refugees, urban poor). The main strategies promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other allies have been focused on developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based practices that can be scaled up through task-shifting and other methods to improve access to services or interventions and reduce the global treatment gap for mental disorders. Recent debates on global mental health have raised questions about the goals and consequences of current approaches. Some of these critiques emphasize the difficulties and potential dangers of applying Western categories, concepts, and interventions given the ways that culture shapes illness experience. The concern is that in the urgency to address disparities in global health, interventions that are not locally relevant and culturally consonant will be exported with negative effects including inappropriate diagnoses and interventions, increased stigma, and poor health outcomes. More fundamentally, exclusive attention to mental disorders identified by psychiatric nosologies may shift attention from social structural determinants of health that are among the root causes of global health disparities. This paper addresses these critiques and suggests how the GMH movement can respond through appropriate modes of community-based practice and ongoing research, while continuing to work for greater equity and social justice in access to effective, socially relevant, culturally safe and appropriate mental health care on a global scale.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One potential solution to limited healthcare access in low and middle income countries (LMIC) is task-shifting- the training of non-physician healthcare workers (NPHWs) to perform tasks traditionally undertaken by physicians. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of studies involving task-shifting for the management of non-communicable disease (NCD) in LMIC., METHODS: A search strategy with the following terms "task-shifting", "non-physician healthcare workers", "community healthcare worker", "hypertension", "diabetes", "cardiovascular disease", "mental health", "depression", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "respiratory disease", "cancer" was conducted using Medline via Pubmed and the Cochrane library. Two reviewers independently reviewed the databases and extracted the data., FINDINGS: Our search generated 7176 articles of which 22 were included in the review. Seven studies were randomised controlled trials and 15 were observational studies. Tasks performed by NPHWs included screening for NCDs and providing primary health care. The majority of studies showed improved health outcomes when compared with usual healthcare, including reductions in blood pressure, increased uptake of medications and lower depression scores. Factors such as training of NPHWs, provision of algorithms and protocols for screening, treatment and drug titration were the main enablers of the task-shifting intervention. The main barriers identified were restrictions on prescribing medications and availability of medicines. Only two studies described cost-effective analyses, both of which demonstrated that task-shifting was cost-effective., CONCLUSIONS: Task-shifting from physicians to NPHWs, if accompanied by health system re-structuring is a potentially effective and affordable strategy for improving access to healthcare for NCDs. Since the majority of study designs reviewed were of inadequate quality, future research methods should include robust evaluations of such strategies.},

  abstract = {Three-quarters of the global mental health burden exists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet the lack of mental health services in resource-poor settings is striking. Task-sharing (also, task-shifting), where mental health care is provided by non-specialists, has been proposed to improve access to mental health care in LMICs. This multi-site qualitative study investigates the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing mental health care in LMICs by examining perceptions of primary care service providers (physicians, nurses, and community health workers), community members, and service users in one district in each of the five countries participating in the PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE (PRIME): Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa, and Uganda. Thirty-six focus group discussions and 164 in-depth interviews were conducted at the pre-implementation stage between February and October 2012 with the objective of developing district level plans to integrate mental health care into primary care. Perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing were evaluated first at the district level in each country through open-coding and then at the cross-country level through a secondary analysis of emergent themes. We found that task-sharing mental health services is perceived to be acceptable and feasible in these LMICs as long as key conditions are met: 1) increased numbers of human resources and better access to medications; 2) ongoing structured supportive supervision at the community and primary care-levels; and 3) adequate training and compensation for health workers involved in task-sharing. Taking into account the socio-cultural context is fundamental for identifying local personnel who can assist in detection of mental illness and facilitate treatment and care as well as training, supervision, and service delivery. By recognizing the systemic challenges and sociocultural nuances that may influence task-sharing mental health care, locally-situated interventions could be more easily planned to provide appropriate and acceptable mental health care in LMICs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite 10 to% of persons living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa having clinical depression, and the consequences of depression for key public health outcomes (HIV treatment adherence and condom use), depression treatment is rarely integrated into HIV care programs. Task-shifting, protocolized approaches to depression care have been used to overcome severe shortages of mental health specialists in developing countries, but not in sub-Saharan Africa and not with HIV clients. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the implementation outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a task-shifting, protocolized model of antidepressant care for HIV clinics in Uganda., METHODS/DESIGN: INDEPTH-Uganda is a cluster randomized controlled trial that compares two task-shifting models of depression care--a protocolized model versus a model that relies on the clinical acumen of trained providers to provide depression care in ten public health HIV clinics in Uganda. In addition to data abstracted from routine data collection mechanisms and supervision logs, survey data will be collected from patient and provider longitudinal cohorts; at each site, a random sample of 150 medically stable patients who are depressed according to the PHQ-2 screening will be followed for 12 months, and providers involved in depression care implementation will be followed over 24 months. These data will be used to assess whether the two models differ on implementation outcomes (proportion screened, diagnosed, treated; provider fidelity to model of care), provider adoption of treatment care knowledge and practices, and depression alleviation.

  abstract = {The United States has a significant shortage of trained geriatricians and of nurses, social workers, and paraprofessionals educated to care for elderly adults. As the aging population continues to grow, providing high-quality care will require new models that better address the many needs of aging individuals and their caregivers, using cost-effective strategies. Responding to this need, the Indiana University Center for Aging Research implementation scientists developed, tested, and are now scaling up a successful collaborative care coordination model for older adults with dementia, depression, or both: the Aging Brain Care program. This model now includes a newly created frontline care provider position, the Care Coordinator Assistant. The Care Coordinator Assistant works with individuals and caregivers to monitor biopsychosocial needs and deliver evidence-based and individualized care protocols, with close supervision from the registered nurse Care Coordinator. Recognizing that current hiring practices for frontline providers were insufficient to screen for critical abilities expected in this new position, including the ability to express "caring" and empathy, a new screening process was created building on the Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) format. The Care Coordinator Assistant MMI comprised six stations, each created to simulate challenging scenarios that will be frequently encountered and to assess important candidate abilities. Overall, the six-station MMI, with two to three items per station, provided factorially valid measures and good predictive ability. The process did not appear to be overly burdensome for candidates, and interviewers noted that it was helpful in discriminating between candidates. © 2014, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2014, The American Geriatrics Society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-morbid depression in HIV-positive patients on anti-retroviral (ART) treatment poses a public health threat. It compromises treatment adherence and accelerates disease progression. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a group-based counselling intervention for depressed HIV-positive patients in primary health care (PHC) in South Africa using a task shifting approach., METHODS: Using a randomized control design, 76 HIV-positive patients with co-morbid depression were initially recruited. This reduced to 34 in the final cohort. Participants were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) at baseline and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was adapted from a local group-based Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) intervention. Process evaluation interviews were held with the HIV counsellors who delivered the intervention and a sub-sample of participants., RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed significantly greater improvement on depression scores on the PHQ9 in the intervention group compared to the control group. A significant decline in the mean scores on the HSCL-25 was found for both groups although this was more pronounced for the intervention group. There was no significant improvement in the MSPSS scores., LIMITATIONS: The small sample size of the final cohort affected the power of the study to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the MSPSS. Longer term impact of the intervention is unknown., CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that group-based counselling for depression in HIV-positive patients can potentially be effectively delivered by appropriately trained and supported lay HIV counsellors. The need for a larger trial is indicated. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Many high-income countries have sophisticated interpreter services, but in low- and middle-income countries there are not sufficient professional services, let alone interpreter services, and task shifting is used. In this article, we discuss this neglected issue in the context of low- and middle-income countries, where task shifting has been suggested as a solution to the problem of scarce mental health resources. The large diversity of languages in low- and middle-income countries, exacerbated by wide-scale migration, has implications for the scale-up of services. We suggest that it would be useful for those who are working innovatively to develop locally delivered mental health programmes in low- and middle-income countries to explore and report on issues of language and how these have been addressed. We need to know more about local challenges, but also about local solutions which seem to work, and for this we need more information from the field than is currently available.},

  abstract = {Depression affects 18-30 % of HIV-infected patients in Africa and is associated with greater stigma, lower antiretroviral adherence, and faster disease progression. However, the region's health system capacity to effectively identify and treat depression is limited. Task-shifting models may help address this large mental health treatment gap. Measurement-Based Care (MBC) is a task-shifting model in which a Depression Care Manager guides a non-psychiatric (e.g., HIV) provider in prescribing and managing antidepressant treatment. We adapted MBC for depressed HIV-infected patients in Cameroon and completed a pilot study to assess feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. We enrolled 55 participants; all started amitriptyline 25-50 mg daily at baseline. By 12 weeks, most remained at 50 mg daily (range 25-125 mg). Median (interquartile range) PHQ-9 depressive severity scores declined from 13 (12-16) (baseline) to 2 (0-3) (week 12); 87 % achieved depression remission (PHQ-9 <5) by 12 weeks. Intervention fidelity was high: HIV providers followed MBC recommendations at 96 % of encounters. Most divergences reflected a failure to increase dose when indicated. No serious and few bothersome side effects were reported. Most suicidality (prevalence 62 % at baseline; 8 % at 12 weeks) was either passive or low-risk. Participant satisfaction was high (100 %), and most participants (89 %) indicated willingness to pay for medications if MBC were implemented in routine care. The adapted MBC intervention demonstrated high feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in this uncontrolled pilot study. Further research should assess whether MBC could improve adherence and HIV outcomes in this setting.},

However, among IDU, access to essential HIV-related services remains unacceptably low, especially in settings where stigma, discrimination, and criminalization exist. These ongoing problems account for a significant amount of preventable morbidity and mortality within this population, and indicate the need for novel approaches to HIV program delivery for IDU. Task shifting is a concept that has been applied successfully in African settings as a way to address health worker shortages. However, to date, this concept has not been applied as a means of addressing the social and structural barriers to HIV prevention and treatment experienced by IDU. Given the growing evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of IDU-run programs in increasing access to healthcare, the time has come to extend the notion of task shifting and apply it in settings where stigma, discrimination, and criminalization continue to pose significant barriers to HIV program access for IDU. By involving IDU more directly in the delivery of HIV programs, task shifting may serve to foster a new era in the response to HIV/AIDS among IDU.},

As part of ongoing programming, voluntary care-workers administered locally validated assessments to identify children who met criteria for moderate to severe trauma symptomatology. Local lay counselors implemented TF-CBT with identified families, while participating in ongoing supervision. Fifty-eight children and adolescents aged 5-18 completed the TF-CBT treatment, with pre- and post-assessments. The mean number of traumas reported by the treatment completers (N=58) was 4.11. Post assessments showed significant reductions in severity of trauma symptoms (p<0.0001), and severity of shame symptoms (p<0.0001). Our results suggest that TF-CBT is a feasible treatment option in Zambia for OVC. A decrease in symptoms suggests that a controlled trial is warranted. Implementation factors monitored suggest that it is feasible to integrate and evaluate evidence-based mental health assessments and intervention into programmatic services run by an NGO in low/middle resource countries. Results also support the effectiveness of implementation strategies such as task shifting, and the Apprenticeship Model of training and supervision. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Multivariable logistic regression models were built to assess determinants of first-choice and lifetime health service use by provider type., RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of respondents endorsed God as their first choice for care if suffering from mental distress, and 29% of respondents endorsed clinics and hospitals as their first choice. Forty-seven percent of respondents chose potential providers on the basis of anticipated efficacy. Suicidal individuals were 7.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.4-42.0) as likely to prefer community-based providers (herbal healer, church priest or pastor, or Vodou priest) over hospitals or clinics. Depression severity was associated with increased odds (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.8, CI=1.5-2.3) of ever having been to an herbal healer. Having a household member with mental health problems was associated with increased odds of ever having been to church pastors or priests (AOR=5.8, CI=2.8-12.0) and decreased odds of ever having been to hospitals or clinics (AOR=.3, CI=.1-.8). Median actual service costs were US $1 for hospitals or clinics, $6 for herbal healers, and $120 for Vodou priests., CONCLUSIONS: Three out of four rural Haitians said they would seek community resources over clinical care if suffering from mental distress. Therefore, isolated clinical interventions may have limited impact because of less frequent use. Efforts to expand mental health care should consider differential provider costs when selecting community resources for task shifting.},

The authors conducted a baseline and two follow-up surveys of 39 children who met the clinical diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. There was a statistically significant improvement for the children on anxiety, but there was no statistically significant improvement on depression, with greatest gains immediately following the intervention.

Subjects were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control arm. Eligible subjects in the intervention arm were given psycho-education, case management, interpersonal psychotherapy and/or antidepressants by lay health workers. Subjects in the control arm were treated by physicians. The use of health-care resources, the disability of each subject and degree of psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule, were determined at 2, 6 and 12 months., FINDINGS: Complete data, from all three follow-ups, were collected from 1243 (75.4%) and 938 (81.7%) of the subjects enrolled in the study facilities from the public and private sectors, respectively. Within the public facilities, subjects in the intervention arm showed greater improvement in all the health outcomes investigated than those in the control arm. Time costs were also significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control arm, whereas health system costs in the two arms were similar. Within the private facilities, however, the effectiveness and costs recorded in the two arms were similar., CONCLUSION: Within public primary-care facilities in Goa, the use of lay health workers in the care of subjects with common mental disorders was not only cost-effective but also cost-saving.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest HIV prevalence worldwide and depression is highly prevalent among those infected. The negative impact of depression on HIV outcomes highlights the need to identify and treat it in this population. A model for doing this in lower-resourced settings involves task-shifting depression treatment to primary care; however, HIV-infected individuals are often treated in a parallel HIV specialty setting. We adapted a model of task-shifting, measurement-based care (MBC), for an HIV clinic setting and tested its feasibility in Tanzania. MBC involves measuring depressive symptoms at meaningful intervals and adjusting antidepressant medication treatment based on the measure of illness., METHOD: Twenty adults presenting for care at an outpatient HIV clinic in Tanzania were enrolled and followed by a nurse care manager who measured depressive symptoms at baseline and every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. An algorithm-based decision-support tool was utilized by the care manager to recommend individualized antidepressant medication doses to participants' HIV providers at each visit., RESULTS: Retention was high and fidelity of the care manager to the MBC protocol was exceptional. Follow through of antidepressant prescription dosing recommendations by the prescriber was low. Limited availability of antidepressants was also noted. Despite challenges, baseline depression scores decreased over the 12-week period., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the model of algorithm-based nursing support of prescription decisions was feasible. Future studies should address implementation issues of medication supply and dosing. Further task-shifting to relatively more abundant and lower-skilled health workers, such as nurses' aides, warrants examination.},

Recurrence of major depression can also be substantially reduced through both psychological and psychopharmacological strategies. Additional research is needed, however, to address the specific issues of depression prevention in older adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The growing number of older adults globally, as well as workforce issues and the expense of interventions, makes it important to develop rational, targeted, and cost-effective risk-reduction strategies. In our opinion, one strategy to address these issues entails the use of lay health counselors (LHCs), a form of task shifting already shown to be effective in the treatment of common mental disorders in LMICs. We suggest in this review that the time is right for research into the translation of depression-prevention strategies for use in LMICs.},

The article begins with an overview of the contribution of four scientific foundations toward the discipline's core agenda: to scale up services for people with mental disorders and to promote their human rights. Next, the article highlights four recent, key events that are indicative of the actions shaping the discipline: the Mental Health Gap Action Programme to synthesize evidence on what treatments are effective for a range of mental disorders; the evidence on task shifting to nonspecialist health workers to deliver these treatments; the Movement for Global Mental Health's efforts to build a common platform for professionals and civil society to advocate for their shared goal; and the Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health, which has identified the research priorities that, within the next decade, can lead to substantial improvements in the lives of people living with mental disorders. The article ends by examining the major challenges for the field, and the opportunities for addressing them in the future.},

This study assessed the feasibility of an adapted manualized version of grouped based Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) for use by supervised community health workers through a pilot study on 60 primary health care clinic users screened as having moderate to severe depression. Retention was good and participants in the group-based IPT intervention showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms on completion of the 12-week intervention as well as 24 weeks post baseline compared to the control group. Qualitative process evaluation suggests that improved social support, individual coping skills and improved personal agency assisted in the reduction of depressive symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND A recent situational analysis suggests that post-apartheid South Africa has made some gains with respect to the decentralization and integration of mental health into primary health care. However, service gaps within and between provinces remain, with rural areas particularly underserved. Aim This study aims to calculate and cost a hypothetical human resource mix required to populate a framework for district adult mental health services. This framework embraces the concept of task shifting, where dedicated low cost mental health workers at the community and clinic levels supplement integrated care. METHOD The expected number and cost of human resources was based on: (a) assumptions of service provision derived from existing services in a sub-district demonstration site and a literature review of evidence-based packages of care in low- and middle-income countries; and (b) assumptions of service needs derived from other studies. RESULTS For a nominal population of 100 000, minimal service coverage estimates of 50% for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder and 30% for post-traumatic stress disorder and maternal depression would require that the primary health care staffing package include one post for a mental health counsellor or equivalent and 7.2 community mental health worker posts. The cost of these personnel amounts to 28 457 per 100 000 population. This cost can be offset by a reduction in the number of other specialist and non-specialist health personnel required to close service gaps at primary care level. CONCLUSION The adoption of the concept of task shifting can substantially reduce the expected number of health care providers otherwise needed to close mental health service gaps at primary health care level in South Africa at minimal cost and may serve as a model for other middle-income countries.},

Literature searches were conducted in Medline, PsychInfo and Sabinet databases from January 2000 to October 2010 using key phrases. Hand searches of key local journals were also conducted. Of 215 articles retrieved, 92 were included. Data were extracted onto a spreadsheet and analysed thematically., RESULTS: While progress in epidemiological studies has been good, there is a paucity of intervention and economic evaluation studies. The majority of studies reviewed were on the status of mental healthcare services. They indicate some progress in decentralised care for severe mental disorders, but also insufficient resources to adequately support community-based services, resulting in the classic revolving-door phenomenon. Common mental disorders remain largely undetected and untreated in primary healthcare. Cross-cutting issues included the need for promoting culturally congruent services as well as mental health literacy to assist in improving help-seeking behaviour, stigma reduction, and reducing defaulting and human rights abuses., CONCLUSION: While there has been some progress in the decentralisation of mental health service provision, substantial gaps in service delivery remain. Intervention research is needed to provide evidence of the organisational and human resource mix requirements, as well as cost-effectiveness of a culturally appropriate, task shifting and stepped care approach for severe and common mental disorders at primary healthcare level.},

We aimed to pilot a low-cost multi-component 'Friendship Bench Intervention' for CMD, locally adapted from problem-solving therapy and delivered by trained and supervised female lay workers to learn if was feasible and possibly effective as well as how best to implement it on a larger scale., METHOD: We trained lay workers for 8 days in screening and monitoring CMD and in delivering the intervention. Ten lay workers screened consecutive adult attenders who either were referred or self-referred to the Friendship Bench between July and December 2007. Those scoring above the validated cut-point of the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) for CMD were potentially eligible. Exclusions were suicide risk or very severe depression. All others were offered 6 sessions of problem-solving therapy (PST) enhanced with a component of activity scheduling. Weekly nurse-led group supervision and monthly supervision from a mental health specialist were provided. Data on SSQ scores at 6 weeks after entering the study were collected by an independent research nurse. Lay workers completed a brief evaluation on their experiences of delivering the intervention., RESULTS: Of 395 potentially eligible, 33 (8%) were excluded due to high risk. Of the 362 left, 2% (7) declined and 10% (35) were lost to follow-up leaving an 88% response rate (n = 320). Over half (n = 166, 52%) had presented with an HIV-related problem. Mean SSQ score fell from 11.3 (sd 1.4) before treatment to 6.5 (sd 2.4) after 3-6 sessions. The drop in SSQ scores was proportional to the number of sessions attended. Nine of the ten lay workers rated themselves as very able to deliver the PST intervention., CONCLUSION: We have found preliminary evidence of a clinically meaningful improvement in CMD associated with locally adapted problem-solving therapy delivered by lay health workers through routine primary health care in an African setting. There is a need to test the effectiveness of this task-shifting mental health intervention in an appropriately powered randomised controlled trial., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: ISRCTN25476759.},

  abstract = {A challenge faced by many countries is to provide adequate human resources for delivery of essential mental health interventions. The overwhelming worldwide shortage of human resources for mental health, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, is well established. Here, we review the current state of human resources for mental health, needs, and strategies for action. At present, human resources for mental health in countries of low and middle income show a serious shortfall that is likely to grow unless effective steps are taken. Evidence suggests that mental health care can be delivered effectively in primary health-care settings, through community-based programmes and task-shifting approaches. Non-specialist health professionals, lay workers, affected individuals, and caregivers with brief training and appropriate supervision by mental health specialists are able to detect, diagnose, treat, and monitor individuals with mental disorders and reduce caregiver burden. We also discuss scale-up costs, human resources management, and leadership for mental health, particularly within the context of low-income and middle-income countries.

  abstract = {There is an urgent need for valid, reliable, and simple-to-use screening tools for HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in South Africa, as little is known about its impact on South Africa's 5.5 million people living with HIV (PLWH). Screening for HAD in South Africa involves several challenges, including few culturally appropriate and validated screening tools, and a shortage of trained personnel to conduct screening. This study examined rates of positive HAD screens as determined by the cutoff score on the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) administered by nonspecialist community health workers (CHWs) in South Africa and examined associations between positive HAD screens and common risk factors for HAD. Sixty-five Xhosa-speaking HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with low CD4 counts and documented ART adherence problems were administered a battery of demographic, psychiatric and neurocognitive screening measures. Positive HAD screens were present in 80% of the sample. Presence of a current alcohol dependence disorder and CD4 counts of 200 or lower were significantly associated with positive HAD screens. HIV-positive South Africans on ART with low CD4 counts and ART adherence problems may be at a very high risk for HAD, highlighting the need for more routine screening and monitoring of neurocognitive functions among South Africa's millions of PLWH on ART. Future research is needed to: (1) validate IHDS performance against a gold standard neurocognitive battery for the detection of HAD among larger samples of Xhosa-speaking South Africans with ART adherence difficulties and (2) compare performance of CHW to expert health care personnel in administering the IHDS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lack of culturally adapted and validated instruments for child mental health and psychosocial support in low and middle-income countries is a barrier to assessing prevalence of mental health problems, evaluating interventions, and determining program cost-effectiveness. Alternative procedures are needed to validate instruments in these settings., METHODS: Six criteria are proposed to evaluate cross-cultural validity of child mental health instruments: (i) purpose of instrument, (ii) construct measured, (iii) contents of construct, (iv) local idioms employed, (v) structure of response sets, and (vi) comparison with other measurable phenomena. These criteria are applied to transcultural translation and alternative validation for the Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) and Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) in Nepal, which recently suffered a decade of war including conscription of child soldiers and widespread displacement of youth. Transcultural translation was conducted with Nepali mental health professionals and six focus groups with children (n=64) aged 11-15 years old. Because of the lack of child mental health professionals in Nepal, a psychosocial counselor performed an alternative validation procedure using psychosocial functioning as a criterion for intervention. The validation sample was 162 children (11-14 years old). The Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) and Global Assessment of Psychosocial Disability (GAPD) were used to derive indication for treatment as the external criterion., RESULTS: The instruments displayed moderate to good psychometric properties: DSRS (area under the curve (AUC)=0.82, sensitivity=0.71, specificity=0.81, cutoff score >= 14); CPSS (AUC=0.77, sensitivity=0.68, specificity=0.73, cutoff score >= 20). The DSRS items with significant discriminant validity were "having energy to complete daily activities" (DSRS.7), "feeling that life is not worth living" (DSRS.10), and "feeling lonely" (DSRS.15). The CPSS items with significant discriminant validity were nightmares (CPSS.2), flashbacks (CPSS.3), traumatic amnesia (CPSS.8), feelings of a foreshortened future (CPSS.12), and easily irritated at small matters (CPSS.14)., CONCLUSIONS: Transcultural translation and alternative validation feasibly can be performed in low clinical resource settings through task-shifting the validation process to trained mental health paraprofessionals using structured interviews. This process is helpful to evaluate cost-effectiveness of psychosocial interventions. Copyright © 2011 Kohrt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of integrated stepped packages of care embracing a task-shifting approach, and best practices for strengthening mental health literacy and collaborative arrangements with community caregivers and other sectors, can assist this process. Specialist mental health training programmes in LMICs also need to be responsive to the changing demands on service providers, incorporating a public health approach and equipping specialists for diversification of their roles within the task shifting model.},

We performed a qualitative analysis to understand factors contributing to poor emotional health and its impact among impoverished Peruvian HIV-infected individuals. We conducted focus group discussions with patients and providers consisting of semistructured, open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the profound impact of depression, isolation, stigma, and lack of social support among these patients. Living with HIV contributed significantly to mental health problems experienced by HIV-positive individuals; furthermore, long-standing stressors-such as economic hardship, fragmented family relationships, and substance use-shaped patients' outlooks, and may have contributed not only to current emotional hardship but to risk factors for contracting HIV as well. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, many patients experienced hopelessness, stigma, and socioeconomic marginalization. Patients tended to rely on informal sources of support, including peers and community health workers, and rarely used formal mental health services. In resource-poor settings, the context of mental health problems among HIV-positive individuals must be framed within the larger structural context of poverty and social exclusion. Optimal strategies to address the mental health problems of these individuals should include integrating mental health services into HIV care, task shifting to utilize community health workers where human resources are scarce, and interventions aimed at poverty alleviation.},

However, only a few countries have adequate mental health resources to undertake the integration of mental health into primary health care in a uniform manner, with wide variations among countries. This paper examines the extent to which two low-income countries (Ghana and Uganda) and one middle-income country (South Africa) are managing the integration of mental health into primary health care using the recommendations of the WHO World Health Report, 2001. Primary and secondary data sources from a situational analysis of mental health services in the three countries were analysed. The findings indicate that significant challenges remain in integrating mental health care into primary health care. Poor or uneven implementation of policy, inadequate access to essential drugs and lack of mental health specialists are some of the reasons advanced. Aside from better human resource planning for mental health, integration may be advanced by the development of packages of care which adopt a task-shifting approach suited to a country's needs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depression is a frequent feature of schizophrenia but the cognitive processes involved in its development and maintenance are unclear. Recent studies have shown that clinical depression is associated with faulty inhibitory mechanisms of selective attention for negative information. The current study examined whether patients with schizophrenia also have an attentional bias towards negative stimuli. The inhibitory processes of interference control and task-shifting abilities were also examined to assess whether patients would show a selective impairment., METHOD: Forty-three patients with schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls completed the Affective Shifting Task., RESULTS: As a group, schizophrenia patients did not show an attentional bias for negative material. However, those patients with high levels of depression demonstrated faster latencies when negative words were the targets, and higher depression scores were found to be associated with an increasing number of false alarms for negative words when they were not the targets. The results also showed that patients had impaired interference control but intact task-shifting abilities., CONCLUSIONS: Faulty inhibitory mechanisms of selective attention for negative information are not a general feature of schizophrenia but appear to be selective to those with a depressed mood. The results highlight the need for further studies examining the exact nature of the affective dysfunction in schizophrenia and the cognitive processes supporting negative emotions.},

By contrast, error rates did not differ between the groups on switch trials (methamphetamine = 7%; controls = 6%; p = .68)., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that selective inhibition, but not task switching, is selectively compromised by methamphetamine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This qualitative study was nested within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where two psychotherapeutic interventions (supportive counselling and prolonged exposure for adolescents) were provided by supervised nurses (who served as 'nurse counsellors') to adolescents with PTSD in school settings. This paper describes the perspectives of nurse counsellors (NCs) and school liaisons (SLs). SLs were teachers or administrative personnel at the schools who coordinated the study visits of participants with the NCs. We focus on the impediments and catalysts to and recommendations for treatment implementation., METHODS: NCs (n = 3) and SLs (n = 3) who participated in the RCT during 2014 were purposively recruited by telephone and participated in face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews that were recorded and doubly transcribed. Thematic content analysis was applied using Atlas.ti software to identify emerging themes. This paper describes the impediments and catalysts to provide psychotherapy by task-shifting in a community setting across three sub-themes: personal, community, and collaborative care., RESULTS: Although nurses were initially resistant to supervision it was central to personally coping with complex interventions, managing traumatic content, and working apart from a multi-disciplinary team. Delivering the interventions in the community presented multiple logistical impediments (e.g. transport, communication, venue suitability) which required creative solutions. In light of resource shortages, networking is central to effective delivery and uptake of the interventions. Collaboration between government departments of health and education may have a major impact on providing school-based psychotherapy through task-shifting., CONCLUSIONS: Impediments to implementation are not insurmountable. This article provides recommendations to maximize the success of task-shifting interventions should they be rolled out.},

Promotores de salud (N = 16) were recruited from a network of primary care practices to participate in three semistructured focus groups. Qualitative analyses revealed that promotores viewed themselves as caretakers of their community and believed that mental health care fell within that role. After being presented with materials of an evidence-based behavioral intervention for anxiety and depression during the focus groups, promotores expressed that the sample materials seemed appropriate for their community, as well as a general perception that they could deliver such strategies with future training. Promotores voiced concerns about potential barriers to patients accessing mental health care, including mental health stigma and poor community mental health literacy, and discussed the potential benefits of involving promotores to address some of these barriers. Overall, results of this study indicate promotor/a support of the idea of mental health task shifting, as well as a perception that their involvement may improve future mental health service utilization and engagement among Latinxs in a rural community.

More than 80% of the world's population reside in these lower resource settings where exposure to adverse living conditions and mass trauma is widespread. However, less than 20% of mental health resources are managed by LMICs. Evidence-informed psychological and psychosocial interventions that have been adapted for trauma-affected LMICs and can be delivered by non-specialist providers offer one solution to filling this treatment gap. While the evidence for these low-intensity interventions is mounting, many challenges remain that impinge on the effective implementation of such interventions in these settings. These include the selection of delivery agents, the duration and methods of training and supervision, and challenges related to implementation and local government ownership. This chapter examines the current literature on low-intensity interventions in LMICs and provides a brief commentary on the existing challenges to implementation.

This research is state-of-the-art and includes the training of new investigators in those regions, as well as sophisticated clinical and neurological assessments making use of leading technologies such as neuroimaging and genetic studies. The book also provides the recent history and caveats related to the abuse of psychiatry globally, with a particular emphasis on the occurrence of these abuses and misuses of psychiatry in Spanish-speaking countries. It focuses primarily on a few selected examples from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world. The selection of authors and essays for this book was based on direct experiences and collaborations of the book editor with many investigators and colleagues at a number of global sites in the United States, Latin America, and Spain. The book presents selected vignettes that target a handful of global initiatives in which the main editor has participated either directly or indirectly, rather than a comprehensive perspective of the field of GMH. These examples, however, provide interesting leads on a number of evidence-based interventions, the forging of true international collaborations, and the possibility of doing state-of-the-art research beyond equity and service concerns, as well as the potential for abuse of unrestrained mental health policies and interventions.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of lay psychosocial counseling among persons with psychological distress in a primary health care setting in rural Nepal. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial in Dang, rural Nepal (NCT03544450). Persons aged 16 and older attending primary care and with a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score of 6 or more were randomized (1:1) to receive either non-medical psychosocial counseling (PSY) or enhanced usual care (EUC). PSY was provided by lay persons with a 6-month training and consisted of 5-weekly counseling sessions of 35-60 min with a culturally adapted solution-focused approach. EUC was provided by trained primary health workers. Participants were followed up at 1 (T1) and 6 months (T2). The primary outcome, response to treatment, was the reduction of minimum 50% in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. Results: A total of 141 participants, predominantly socially disadvantaged women, were randomized to receive PSY and 146 to EUC. In the PSY, 123 participants and 134 in the EUC were analyzed. In PSY, 101 participants (81.4%) had a response compared with 57 participants (42.5%) in EUC [percentage difference 39.4% (95% CI 28.4-50.4)]. The difference in BDI scores at T2 between PSY and EUC was -7.43 (95% CI -9.71 to -5.14). Conclusions: Non-medical (lay) psychosocial counseling appears effective in reducing depressive symptoms, and its inclusion in mental health care should be considered in low-resource settings.

The labor intensiveness of these interventions prevents the transfer of tasks to other health professionals, necessitating the training of paraprofessionals who focus on these treatments. However, ongoing concerns about the ability of paraprofessionals to learn and provide these treatments at scale have led to the development of expurgated versions of the standard psychotherapies that are still undergoing testing. There are also efforts to reduce or remove reliance on paraprofessionals through technology-based self-administered treatments. Developing an adapted treatment suitable for task shifting can be a difficult task. The final version must explain the material in ways that are understandable and acceptable to both providers and clients. Ensuring this requires a systematic iterative process.

  abstract  = {Psychological therapies have, for a long time, been relegated to an adjunctive or secondary role in the treatment of mental health problems, in comparison with pharmacological therapies, not least because most mental health professionals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are psychiatrists who had neither the training nor the inclination to deliver these therapies. This volume lays out the impressive evidence of the acceptability and effectiveness for a range of mental health problems across the life course and in diverse contexts and for a range of goals from promotion and prevention, to the treatment of acute phases of illness, to rehabilitation and recovery. This book takes a detailed look at how psychotherapies can be adapted and implemented in low- and middle-income countries, while also illuminating the challenges and how to overcome them. It addresses the conceptual framework underlying global mental health and psychotherapy, focusing on the importance of task-shifting, a common-elements approach, rigorous supervision, and the scaling up of psychotherapies. Specific psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy and collaborative care are given in-depth coverage, as is working with special populations, such as children and adolescents, pregnant women, refugees, and the elderly. The book also covers treatment strategies for common disorders, such as depression, anxiety and stress, and substance abuse, as are strategies for more severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia. This volume is not only the first comprehensive account of this rich body of evidence but also a very timely one, with the goal of taking stock of the progress to date, addressing some key questions that have hindered the global application of these therapies, and allowing reflection on the implications of this evidence for transforming mental health globally.

  abstract  = {Background: Chronic pain is associated with emotional problems as well as difficulties in cognitive functioning. Prior experimental studies have shown that optimism, the tendency to expect that good things happen in the future, and positive emotions can counteract pain-induced task performance deficits in healthy participants. More specifically, induced optimism was found to buffer against the negative effects of experimental pain on executive functioning. This clinical experiment examined whether this beneficial effect can be extended to a chronic pain population. Methods: Patients (N = 122) were randomized to a positive psychology Internet-based intervention (PPI; n = 74) or a waiting list control condition (WLC; n = 48). The PPI consisted of positive psychology exercises that particularly target optimism, positive emotions and self-compassion. Results: Results demonstrated that patients in the PPI condition scored higher on happiness, optimism, positive future expectancies, positive affect, self-compassion and ability to live a desired life despite pain, and scored lower on pain catastrophizing, depression and anxiety compared to patients in the WLC condition. However, executive task performance did not improve following completion of the PPI, compared to the WLC condition. Conclusions: Despite the lack of evidence that positive emotions and optimism can improve executive task performance in chronic pain patients, this study did convincingly demonstrate that it is possible to increase positive emotions and optimism in chronic pain patients with an online positive psychology intervention. It is imperative to further explore amendable psychological factors that may reduce the negative impact of pain on executive functioning. Significance: We demonstrated that an Internet-based positive psychology intervention strengthens optimism and positive emotions in chronic pain patients. These emotional improvements are not associated with improved executive task performance. As pain itself often cannot be relieved, it is imperative to have techniques to reduce the burden of living with chronic pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {"Task shifting," where tasks typically reserved for specialist providers are redistributed to trained nonspecialists (e.g., peers), has been an effective approach to increase access to quality health services in developing countries. Such an approach may be an effective method to address the treatment gap in the United States between mental health services received by Latina mothers and mothers who are non-Latina and White. This study explores perspectives of Latina women (n = 16) and local health care providers (n = 14) on a peer-delivered therapy model. A community-based research approach and qualitative methods were used, including focus groups and semistructured interviews. Themes were identified using a grounded theory and framework analysis approach. The findings indicate important barriers to care, including the fact that, among Latinas, depression is often viewed as a sign of weakness, isolation, or shame. Participants also indicated that mental health resources were insufficient, and other barriers to accessing services included language and lack of transportation. All participants reported a positive view of the concept of a peer-delivered model, yet concerns were also expressed regarding ensuring adequate supervision and confidentiality, as well as how to recruit and retain women in the program. Additional cultural considerations also were identified, including trust concerns, how to respond to histories of trauma, and the importance of biculturalism and a sense of community. These findings highlight the importance of a collaborative approach to build on key lessons and codevelop a peer model with Latina women to ensure effective cultural adaptation and sustainability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Spanish) "El cambio de tareas," una opcion donde ciertas tareas tipicamente reservadas para especialistas se redistribuyen entre personas no especializadas pero debidamente entrenadas (pares o colegas), ha demostrado ser un enfoque eficaz, en los paises en desarrollo, para incrementar el acceso a los servicios de salud de calidad. Este enfoque puede constituir un metodo eficaz para abordar la brecha (o la diferencia) existente en Estados Unidos, entre el servicio de salud mental que reciben las madres latinas por un lado y las madres no-latinas y blancas-por el otro. Este estudio explora las perspectivas de las mujeres latinas (n = 16) y de los proveedores locales de salud (n = 14) que utilizan un modelo de terapia "entre pares". En dicho estudio se utilizo un enfoque comunitario y metodos cualitativos que, incluyeron entrevistas semiestructuradas y grupos focalizados. Para la identificacion de los temas se utilizo marco teorico y un marco logico predeterminados. Los resultados indican la necesidad de tomar en consideracion algunos impedimentos importantes como por ejemplo el hecho de que, entre Latinas, la depresion es frecuentemente vista como una senal de debilidad, de soledad, o de verguenza. Algunos participantes tambien senalaron la insuficiencia de-recursos para la salud mental y la existencia de otras barreras para el acceso a los servicios como las barreras del idioma y la carencia de medios de transporte. Todos los participantes manifestaron una opinion favorable respecto del modo de terapia "entre pares" aunque tambien se expresaron inquietudes acerca de como asegurar la confidencialidad y una adecuada supervision como asi tambien, a acerca de como reclutar y como retener a las mujeres en el programa. Ademas aparecieron otras consideraciones culturales tales como preocupaciones acerca de la confianza, de como responder a las historias traumaticas y de la importancia del biculturalismo y del sentimiento de comunidad. Estos resultados ilustran la importancia de construir un enfoque colaborativo con pautas claves, y de codesarrollar un modelo entre pares con las mujeres latinas para asegurar su efectiva y sustentable adaptacion cultural.

In the original article, the reference 35 was published incorrectly. The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-25831-001). Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a 5-session, psychological intervention program delivered by trained non-specialist that addresses common mental disorders. The objectives of this study are to evaluate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PM+ in a specialized mental health care facility in Pakistan. Methods: A single blind individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be carried out in the outpatient department of a specialized mental healthcare facility in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. After informed consent, patients with high psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 (score >2) and functional impairment (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 score >16) will be randomised to PM+ plus treatment as usual (n = 96) or TAU only (n = 96). The primary outcome is the psychological distress, measured by levels of anxiety and depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and improvement in functioning as measured by WHODAS at 20 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes include improvement in symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, levels of social support and cost effectiveness evaluation. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to evaluate the process of implementing PM+ including barriers and facilitators in implementation and possibility of integration of PM+ program in specialized mental health care facilities in Pakistan. Discussion: The results of this study will be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the approach of training non specialists, based in the specialized mental health care facilities in delivering evidence based psychological interventions in the low resource settings.

  abstract  = {There is a global need to provide human resources for health in low- and middle-income countries. To increase access to care, task shifting has been implemented in community-based rehabilitation (CBR) programs where skills and responsibilities are transferred to local people with shorter and more focused training. Through realist review and synthesis, this research aimed to consolidate the literature when considering (a) what skills CBR workers are reportedly using and/or being trained in relating to mental health, (b) how different settings affect how these task shifting programs work, and (c) the evidence of effectiveness when community health workers come from within the community itself. A total of 11 databases (PubMed, ABI/Inform Global, CINAHL, Cochrane, Emerald, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, SAGE, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science) were systematically searched for specific terms relating to mental health, CBR, and low- and middle-income country. A total of 27 publications were identified as fitting the criteria (4 qualitative, 20 quantitative including 10 randomized controlled trials, and 3 noninvestigatory editorials). Core skills have been identified along with themes that affect how programs work in particular contexts. The use of task shifting in this area may be a potentially viable option for increasing access to mental health care. This resulted in the development of a theory to explain the outcomes being observed. When Task-shifting mental health intervention skills collaboration, harnessing resources available within the community, and the provision of ongoing supervision interact to influence awareness gains, social bonding, the building of trust, and the development of skills and understanding within the community itself. This effects intervention buy-in, overall effectiveness and sustainability, mental health symptoms and local empowerment. These findings can be considered when developing training programs for CBR mental health workers, as well as policy and intervention program design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Impact and Implications-Currently many lower economic status communities are dependent on external support for the provision of health care and rehabilitation services. This research investigated the options for task-shifting care into communities to increase access to care and empower the historically impoverished. It walks policy and program developers through skills being used in community-based rehabilitation and consolidates which mechanisms and contexts contribute to successful and unsuccessful outcomes. This research hopes to influence building equitable and sustainable mental health care systems that successfully support well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Despite decades of world-class, innovative treatment research, growing governmental and public attention to mental health issues, and decreasing stigma around seeking care, the supply of tools and resources available to combat the burdens of mental illness globally are vastly outweighed by demand for services. Innovations in Psychosocial Interventions and Their Delivery provides an integrated and detailed overview of advances, challenges, and necessary new directions with regard to evidence-based psychological interventions. Drawing on diverse fields such as public health, business, entertainment, social policy and law, and other domains that may inform efforts to deliver interventions more effectively, Alan Kazdin explores an assortment of novel and inventive ways to address the world's mental health crisis. Focusing attention on promising scientific developments and the special challenges that emerge in evaluating and delivering such interventions, the book examines opportunities such as trans-diagnostic treatments, inventive uses of technology, complementary approaches, novel methods of dissemination such as task-shifting, and more.

  abstract  = {The United Republic of Tanzania is at a crucial stage in the development of its mental health system. As of 2009, there were 18 psychiatrists serving this nation of 51 million people despite depression ranking as Tanzania's number one cause of disability. Modest efforts have been made to expand services, but few studies have documented the state of mental health treatment in the nation. The current research represents a formative effort to assess mental health needs in northern Tanzania and inform the investment of resources to improve care. To achieve these aims, we conducted semistructured interviews with 29 mental health providers examining their perceptions of the treatment currently offered, characteristics of patient populations, and future directions in treatment. Responses were analyzed using consensual qualitative research, and these offer nuanced insights into the Tanzanian context. Alcohol and substance abuse, schizophrenia, and stress related to social challenges were the most commonly described mental health concerns. Interviewees acknowledged critical shortfalls in providers, facilities, or resources dedicated to mental health; little coordination among services; and multiple barriers that prevent all but the most severely impaired patients from receiving care. Despite these challenges, the majority of the providers believed that treatment would improve in the future. Implications of these results for the development of the mental health system in Tanzania include the necessity for: (a) improving the availability and quality of services by dedicating new resources, (b) maximizing existing resources through task-shifting and improved training, and (c) addressing barriers to treatment via public education and community outreach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Impact and Implications-The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals emphasize the importance of "well-being for all" and the elimination of global health disparities. Mental illness is increasingly being recognized as one of the greatest contributors to disability worldwide, but nation-by-nation disparities in treatment are arguably greater than any other category of disease. This research reports insights from Tanzanian mental health providers to highlight treatment disparities in this nation and consider areas of growth for the mental health system in the coming years.

We demonstrate how in attempting to address the high prevalence of maternal mental ill-health and bridge the gap in treatment, both projects draw upon the global recommendation of task-shifting, but intimately entangle it with South African realities, lexicons and matrixes. We describe these projects separately and explore how their main features are shaped by, and tailored towards, the South African context. We also consider some of the costs, benefits and potential replicability/transferability of these projects. In the concluding section of this chapter, we attempt to show how these two projects synthesize both global and local knowledge in relatively novel ways and in turn speak to some of the critical concerns that have been raised about the dominant model of care being proposed. We touch on what insights these projects may offer for the development of further maternal mental health services in South Africa and potentially elsewhere.

In part, this involves paying attention both to more general critiques of psychiatry in HICs-for such critiques may still apply or magnify when exported globally-and to critiques that are focused more specifically on the export of mental health services dominated by psychiatry to LMICs, The questions to be considered include: Is the validity of psychiatric diagnosis being overemphasized? Is a preoccupation with eliminating symptoms of illness obscuring understanding about what constitutes 'positive outcomes' for individuals experiencing mental health difficulties? Is the 'treatment gap' in LMICs as large as it is reported to be? Are alternative forms of support being neglected? Are social determinants of mental health being sufficiently considered? Is the evidence base for GMH sufficiently broad, and has the efficacy of 'task-shifting' been sufficiently demonstrated? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {In this chapter, we aim to demonstrate how the use of task shifting for delivering biomedical HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa can inform efforts to use task shifting models to deliver behavioral medicine interventions for individuals living with HIV/ AIDS in this setting. In doing so, we first describe the widespread HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and the shortage of trained health care providers to meet the needs of the epidemic. We describe task shifting efforts for expanding access to HIV medication in sub-Saharan Africa, and then illustrate how this approach to task shifting can be used to inform a similar approach for evidence-based behavioral medicine interventions among individuals living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. We move from a broad overview of task shifting in HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa to specific examples of task shifting efforts to deliver evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) among individuals living with HiV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. These efforts to task shift CBT address HIV medication adherence and commonly co-occurring psychological symptoms that interfere with successful HIV/ AIDS outcomes, including depression and substance use. Although at the time of writing there have been few examples of task shifting of CBT to address psychosocial and behavioral medicine issues among individuals living with HIV/AIDS in in sub- Saharan Africa, there have been a few promising early examples, including in the treatment of depression in Zimbabwe, the treatment of alcohol use in Kenya, and integrated interventions for depression and HIV medication adherence in South Africa. From these in-depth examples of task shifting CBT for alcohol use, depression, and integrated adherence interventions, we discuss considerations when adapting and implementing CBT using a task shifting model in this population. Finally, we discuss future directions and novel methodologies, for instance using multimedia-based interventions to promote standardization of task shifting delivery of CBT interventions and/or facilitate the use of these techniques by live interventionists. We also discuss the need to move from efficacy and effectiveness designs to more implementation science focused methods to promote sustainable integration of CBT for behavioral medicine in HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa.

The situation is particularly grim in India where almost 30 % of population of the country consists of children in the age group between 0 and 14 years. There could be several possible reasons for this gap ranging from stigma associated with mental illnesses, lack of resources for mental health and apathy on part of policy makers to counter this problem. Although several steps have been taken like formulation of national mental health policy and programme(s) to increase coverage for mental health in India, a lot remains to be done. In the chapter, we emphasize that access to mental health care is a human right and describe the current mental health resource situation for children and adolescents in India, and highlight certain alternate modes of service delivery like school mental health services, provision of services at primary care and use of technology to reach remote areas. We also emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary training of child and adolescent mental health professionals, introduction of topics related to child and adolescent mental health in psychiatry, pediatrics and undergraduate curriculum as well as task sharing/task shifting approaches.

The World Health Organization and other relevant bodies are seeking to reduce this gap through culturally innovative and sensitive programming. In Ghana, for example, only 2 % of the mentally ill access treatment, which means that 98 % do not receive care. Various discourses are ongoing to scale up mental health services in Ghana. One of these is the fostering of a collaborative framework between lay mental health workers (such as religious leaders or faith healers) and professional mental health workers. This article seeks to provide a framework within which collaborative linkages between religious leaders (e.g., the clergy, traditional healers) and professional mental health workers can be established. The article begins with a brief overview of Ghana's mental health landscape, followed by a description of the challenges that make collaboration a difficult task. Next, the need for a holistic view of health in Ghana is addressed by examining Engel's biopsychosocial model and Twumasi's work on the complementary role of traditional systems. The essay ends by providing a three-step approach-understanding, task shifting, and broadened curricula-as a model to guide any collaboration between religious leaders and health practitioners in Ghana.

This exacerbates the nursing shortage in China, further reducing the potential for task-shifting innovations in mental health care. Inadequate nursing staff will also increase the workload of existing nurses and thus reduce the quality of care and patient safety, which might increase patient mortality and perpetuate a vicious cycle of violence. There might not be short-term solutions to prevent medical violence in China because factors associated with patient and family dissatisfaction and anger are multifaceted, including increased medical costs, long patient waiting times, inadequate communication, fear of unfair treatment, and lack of trust in medical professionals. Despite these challenges, measures to secure nursing safety are needed. Hospital administrators and law enforcement officials should work collaboratively to enact a zero tolerance policy for violence against nurses. The existing medical system relies on strict hierarchical structures that prevent nurses from advocating and communicating effectively with patients and their family members. Enhanced patient communication skills, crisis management, and further training in the social context of illness might enhance nurses' ability to provide compassionate medical care. At present, these key competencies are not widely included in nursing education. Psychiatric subspecialty programs in nursing are also not available.

Objective: To collect essential information on Mozambique's MH system for decision making, to improve quality of services delivered, update MH Strategy and Action Plan. Method: The study used the WHO-AIMS to assess MH systems including policy and legislation, organization of services, MH in primary care, human resources, public education and link with other sectors, monitoring and research. A comparative analysis was conducted to present the evolution of relevant data from 2010 to 2014. Results: There are two psychiatric hospitals in the country and beds in general hospitals. In the period, the number of beds in general hospitals remained stable (203), and the beds in psychiatric hospitals increased from 173 to 298. Mental health outpatient facilities have increased from 83 to 152. The number of psychiatrists (9 in 2010, and 10 in 2014) remained very low, with a significant increase in the number of psychologists (56-109) and occupational therapists (2-23). The number of Psychiatric Technicians has increased from 66 in 2010, to 241 in 2014. This increase allowed the mental health network to expand from 60 to 135 Districts, meaning an increase of coverage from 44 to 100 % of the country districts. Conclusion: The task-shifting strategy focused on services delivered in primary care by psychiatric technicians, mid-level professionals, allowed the expansion of mental health services for all the country districts and the reduction of treatment gap in Mozambique.

Our objective was to test the effectiveness of two counseling therapies in Southern Iraq in addressing multiple mental health problems among survivors of systematic violence: (1) a transdiagnostic intervention (Common Elements Treatment Approach or CETA); and (2) cognitive processing therapy (CPT). The therapies were provided by non-specialized health workers since few MH professionals are available to provide therapy in Iraq.Methods: This was a randomized, parallel, two site, two-arm (1:1 allocation), single-blinded, wait-list controlled (WLC) trial of CETA in one site (99 CETA, 50 WLC), and CPT in a second site (129 CPT, 64 WLC). Eligibility criteria were elevated trauma symptoms and experience of systematic violence. The primary and secondary outcomes were trauma symptoms and dysfunction, respectively, with additional assessment of depression and anxiety symptoms. Non-specialized health workers (community mental health worker, CMHW) provided the interventions in government-run primary health centers. Treatment effects were determined using longitudinal, multilevel models with CMHW and client as random effects, and a time by group interaction with robust variance estimation, to test for the net difference in mean score for each outcome between the baseline and follow up interview. Multiple imputation techniques were used to account for missingness at the item level and the participant level. All analyses were conducted using Stata 12.Results: The CETA intervention showed large effect sizes for all outcomes. The CPT intervention showed moderate effects sizes for trauma and depression, with small to no effect for anxiety or dysfunction, respectively.Conclusions: Both CETA and CPT appear to benefit survivors of systematic violence in Southern Iraq by reducing multiple mental health symptoms, with CETA providing a very large benefit across a range of symptoms. Non-specialized health workers were able to treat comorbid symptoms of trauma, depression and anxiety, and dysfunction among survivors of systematic violence who have limited access to mental health professionals. The trial further supports the use of evidence-based therapies in lower-resource settings.Trial registration and protocol: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2010 with an identifier of NCT01177072 as the Study of Effectiveness of Mental Health Interventions among Torture Survivors in Southern Iraq.

  abstract  = {In this issue of the Journal, Nimgaonkar and Menon have described the results of an attempt of employing general health workers to provide basic psychosocial supportive intervention to patients with mental health problems in a highly underserved tribal area in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The results are hearteningly encouraging - with brief training, lay health workers were able to identify persons with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, refer them to physicians, provide basic psychosocial interventions and follow them up. Outcome of their intervention, simplistically evaluated by assessing the improvement of their functional ability, was promising. The cost involved in achieving this was also modest. There are a few methodological concerns about this study. The authors have used focus groups, rather than standard screening tools, to identify case; they did not use any standardized tools to measure the outcome of their intervention; while the costs were analyzed, there was no cost-benefit analysis. Despite these limitations, this report is significant because it provides support to the feasibility and importance of task shifting in managing psychiatric conditions in poorly served areas, a common feature in most low and middle income (LAMI) countries. This editorial reflects on task-shifting as a method of reducing treatment gap in low-middle income countries, and offers some caveats. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Background: Common mental disorders (CMD) are a leading cause of disability globally. Emerging evidence indicates that in low and middle income countries the treatment gap for CMD can be addressed through the use of trained and supervised lay health workers (LHWs). Few clinical trials have evaluated the use of such task-shifting approaches in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe, we have successfully piloted a task-shifting intervention delivered by LHWs. This protocol describes a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of this intervention. Methods: Each of 24 randomly selected clinics from a pool of 42 in Harare will recruit 24 participants (N = 576). The clinics are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the intervention package [a problem solving therapy package delivered over a 4-6 week period by LHWs (N = 24) followed by a 6-week group support programme which focuses mainly on teaching a craft skill] or enhanced usual care, which includes usual care and psycho-education. Primary care attenders aged 18 years and above who score positive on a locally validated CMD screening questionnaire (Shona Symptom Questionnaire, SSQ-14) will be eligible for recruitment and asked for informed consent to participate in the trial. The primary measure is the SSQ score at 6 months. Conclusion: This effectiveness trial using LHWs to address the treatment gap for CMD will contribute to the body of knowledge on the feasibility and ability for scale-up of interventions for CMD.

  abstract  = {Decades of psychotherapy research have yielded a few hundred interventions with strong evidence on their behalf. In the prior companion article, methodological and substantive concerns were raised in relation to what we can say about evidence-based psychotherapies and their impact. Among the methodological concerns are the control conditions to which evidence-based psychotherapies are compared, selective reporting of measures, and the paucity of evidence that evidence-based psychotherapies have clinically significant impact. Among the substantive concerns are limited findings to help direct patients to treatments from which they are likely to profit and to understand the mechanisms responsible for therapeutic change. In this article, two shifts in evidence-based psychotherapy research are highlighted to convey novel and needed directions to augment the impact of treatment and the scale on which it can be delivered. First, transdiagnosis and transtreatment are discussed as a departure from traditional evidence-based psychotherapy research by emphasizing interventions that can be applied across multiple domains. Common biological, psychological, and environmental underpinnings of many disorders and select treatments showing reliable changes across multiple problems are altering evidence-based psychotherapy research. Second, novel models of treatment delivery have emerged from global health care, business, economics, and the media, and are well outside of mainstream mental health professions. Two models (task shifting and best-buy interventions) illustrate how different ways of delivering treatment are essential to reach large and diverse swaths of unserved individuals and have impact on the burden of mental illness.

  abstract  = {Human resources for mental health (HRMH) continue to be grossly inadequate in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and those available are concentrated in urban settings. The very small increase in the number of psychiatrists in the majority of MICs and an actual decrease in LICs raises concerns and has serious implications for HRMH. The shortage and distribution difficulties are likely to worsen unless significant investments are made to train a wider range of specialist and non-specialist mental health care providers in substantially higher numbers, and strategies are in place to address underserved areas. Practical guidelines to assist policymakers, health planners, and educators to address shortages of HRMH are now available, and evidence on new and feasible models of mental health services from LMICs is emerging. An essential response to scaling up of HRMH and to develop a sustainable and comprehensive mental health system in LMICs includes task shifting, defined as "delegating tasks to existing or new cadres with either less training or narrowly tailored training. This is particularly important for three reasons: (I) Most countries simply do not have sufficient numbers of mental health specialists to meet the population needs for mental health care; (2) there are particular tasks of mental health care that can be delivered by non-specialist health workers with sufficient training and supervision; and (3) the increasing shift towards a comprehensive and recovery-based system of care necessitates an increasingly multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach to mental heath reform. Also critically important is implementation of a systemic approach, such as the Human Resources for Health Action Framework (HRH Action Framework) developed by the World Health Organization. This includes six interconnected components: policy, health workforce management, finance, education, partnership, and leadership. The current scarcity of evidence on interventions to strengthen HRMH poses challenges in developing evidence-informed HRMH strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The evidence supporting most psychological treatments has come from studies in which the intervention has been delivered by highly trained health care professionals. If psychological treatments are to have the greatest penetration, priority must be given to the optimization of program-led interventions. The optimization of program-led treatments will not be enough on its own. It needs to be accompanied by research on how to maximize treatment penetration. To achieve the ambitious goals, collaboration needs to be forged between individuals who develop psychological treatments and those in the fields of public mental health and global mental health in particular. With such collaboration, and given recent advances in treatment, training, and technology,much might be achieved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract  = {Statement of Problem: Community-based health service providers serve an integral function in health programs due to their being embedded in the communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are a range of workers who receive less formal training than professional counterparts. Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs) are a type of CHW with distinct differences in the burden and responsibilities of their work, as well as unique sets of challenges and tasks facing CMHWs on the individual. CMHWs are being employed using task shifting, which is the inclusion of non-technical workers in jobs that would otherwise have to be completed by highly skilled health workers. Current literature points to generalized reasons for motivation and retention, while noting the importance of context-specific factors, however, as a relatively new cadre of workers, data originating directly from CMHWs regarding reasons for motivation and retention is lacking. Methods: This study was conducted under a parent project randomized controlled trial that started in 2010. Participants for this study included counselors (n=20) and clinical supervisors (n=3) working on the parent project through their respective organizations. Four rounds of in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data in order to develop a theory of CMHW motivation. Results: Although individual-level factors play a large role in motivation, most important are issues related to system functioning. Inadequate pay, lack of job security, and poor communication were reported to greatly affect CMHW motivation. CMHWs were able to overcome most obstacles they faced in terms of community- and client-level factors; however, the financial systems of their organizations and a lack of continued funding led to changes in motivation, increased potential for attrition, and anxiety for the CMHWs. Conclusions: The results indicate that efforts to ensure client and community support for the work of CMHWs, as well as inputs such as training and supervision, can contribute greatly to service provider motivation. In addition, long-term financial stability of the organizations employing these service providers is essential for continued motivation and retention.

  abstract  = {This article focuses psychiatric rehabilitation that has been developed, studied, and implemented primarily if not exclusively in urban settings, where formal and funded services are much more available than in rural and remote communities. The community mental health program provides services to sites located in remote communities. The rural or remote psychiatric rehabilitation (rPSR) program is supported by academic psychiatrists from Southern Canada, who provide fly-in and telehealth consultations to the program and to local family physicians regarding the program's adult service users. The program also provides psychotherapies to service users and in-person and distance education to its clinicians. A particularly important component of the program is the use of telehealth technologies, which offer innovative ways of solving some of the struggles in accessing services from remote or rural communities. In spite of some challenges, rPSR is promising as a means to facilitate recovery of people with psychiatric disability in their rural and remote environments of choice. It requires clinical, administrative, and other strategies beyond those of standard psychiatric rehabilitation, such as task shifting and coverage by clinicians across proximal sites.

  abstract  = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to review the history of mental health service improvement in Kenya, to discuss current provision of services, challenges to the provision of services and future needs for services. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of a literature review. Findings: Mental health care in Kenya has been a progressing field, though the momentum of progress has been less than desired. The reasons for this are complex including a lack of evidence of the size of the mental health burden which has undermined the political will to focus scarce resources in this area, lack of human resources, models of prevention, and robust mental health legislation. Traditional healers have a significant place in mental health care, these plus efforts to increase training on mental health, task shifting for other clinicians and also prevention may be important steps in improving access to care. Research limitations/implications: The review highlights how much remains to be done to improve mental health services in Kenya. It demonstrates the need for good epidemiological and intervention data to support a multi-level approach, involving government, non-governmental organizations, communities, families, affected individuals and other stakeholders. Prevention and treatment strategies should be streamlined and emphasis put on stigma reduction as well as provision of accessible, acceptable, sustainable and affordable care. Practical implications: A review of the literature is useful to highlight what is known but also what information is missing and is needed to go forward. Originality/value: This is the first system level historical review of the development of mental health services in Kenya. It offers a model for investigation that may be useful for others.

  abstract  = {Three experiments were conducted to develop a computer-based measure of individual differences in resultant achievement motivation (RAM) on the basis of level-of-aspiration, achievement motivation, and dynamics-of-action theories. In Experiment 1, the number of atypical shifts and greater responsiveness to incentives on 21 trials with choices among easy, intermediate, and difficult levels of an achievement-oriented game were positively correlated and were found to differentiate the 62 subjects (31 men, 31 women) on the amount of time they spent at a nonachievement task (watching a color design) 1 week later. In Experiment 2, test-retest reliability was established with the use of 67 subjects (15 men, 52 women). Point and no-point trials were offered in blocks, with point trials first for half the subjects and no-point trials first for the other half. In Experiment 3, computer anxiety was manipulated by creating a simulated computer breakdown in the experimental condition. Fifty-nine subjects (13 men, 46 women) were randomly assigned to the experimental condition or to one of two control conditions (an interruption condition and a no-interruption condition). Subjects with low RAM, as demonstrated by a low number of typical shifts, took longer to choose the achievement-oriented task, as predicted by the dynamics-of-action theory. The difference was evident in all conditions and most striking in the computer-breakdown condition. A change of focus from atypical to typical shifts is discussed.
